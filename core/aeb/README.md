## 1. Data pipeline

AEB is a consumer of `RadarThread`:

```python
rt = registry.get_thread("radar_thread")
with rt.data._lock:
    vehicles      = rt.data.vehicles
    tmp_session   = rt.data.tmp_session
    ego_x, ego_y, ego_z = rt.data.ego_x, rt.data.ego_y, rt.data.ego_z
    ego_yaw_rad   = rt.data.ego_yaw_rad
    ego_speed     = rt.data.ego_speed
    ego_pitch_rad = rt.data.ego_pitch_rad
    ego_steer     = rt.data.ego_steer
    ego_curvature = rt.data.ego_curvature      # may be None
    paused        = rt.data.paused
```

Vehicle instances are shared references: do not mutate them from AEB. All
smoothing, yaw EMA, position history, and curvature state is produced once
per frame by the radar thread.

### TMP trailer-as-vehicle kinematic swap

In TMP sessions, other players' trailers appear as separate top-level radar
vehicles (`is_tmp=True`, `is_trailer=True`). The shared-memory speed field for
those slots has no engine telemetry: it commonly reports 0: and the
position-history LS fit can also return 0 during transients (small chord,
stall, fresh spawn). Without correction, AEB sees a "stationary" obstacle
directly ahead of ego and triggers falsely.

`_swap_trailer_kinematics()` in `thread.py` walks the vehicle list once at the
top of each loop. For every `is_tmp` + `is_trailer` entry it locates the
nearest non-trailer TMP vehicle within 30 m (the pulling tractor) and returns
a shallow copy with `speed` and `acceleration` replaced by the tractor's
filtered values. The trailer's pose, yaw, curvature, and trailer-flag stay
its own: only the kinematics it cannot self-measure are inherited. ACC has
the same swap in `core/acc/tracker.py::_top_leads`.

Only the precompute and main collision iterations consume `vehicles_eff`. The
radar visualizer still reads the original `vehicles` so raw vs filtered speed
displays remain meaningful for debugging the source data.

### Ego curvature: steer-led, gain adapted, grip capped

AEB **does not** consume `RadarData.ego_curvature` (the 25-sample
position-history fit). The ego path must react instantly to steering input;
a history-based fit lags the truck through a transient steer and either
smears the ego corridor onto the outgoing lane (false positive after the
corner clears) or leaves it pointing at the previous lane (false negative
into the corner).

The path comes from `EgoPathModel` (`core/radar/ego_path_model.py`), stepped
once per new radar frame on the simulated clock. It is the old steer proxy
plus the two things that proxy could not know: which vehicle is being driven,
and whether it can still hold the line the wheel is asking for.

```python
capped     = sign(steer) * min(|gain * steer|, cap)   # cap = EMA of |kappa_meas| * 1.10
kappa_path = (1 - w) * gain * steer + w * capped      # w: how much the cap owns
```

- **Gain** starts at `cal.ego_path_gain_prior`, still the historical
  `radians(12)` = 0.2094, and is learned per vehicle from the driven line.
  Per-vehicle gains run 0.09 to 0.24: a long bus turns far less per unit steer
  than a 4x2 tractor, so a fixed value draws a corridor up to twice too tight.
  The prior stays historical on purpose. The fleet median is 0.19, but moving
  the prior there was measured and rejected: on one corpus vehicle the truth is
  0.137 and on another 0.205, so a median prior is a coin flip that shifts every
  filter threshold at once. A measured per-vehicle gain is the accuracy claim;
  the prior is only where a fresh session starts.
- **Cap**: saturation is detected, never assumed from a constant. Measured
  saturated plateaus run 6 to 13 m/s^2 and rise with speed, so a fixed
  lateral-g ceiling would either bind on ordinary cornering or never bind.
  The cap is what the vehicle is currently measured to hold.
- **`w` is confirmed first, then ramped, and both halves are load-bearing.**
  `sat_enter_s` of sustained evidence arms the cap; only then does `w` move,
  toward a target that follows the measured/commanded ratio (full at
  `sat_ratio`, zero at `sat_release_ratio`), at `sat_ramp_s` up and
  `sat_exit_s` down. The cap value itself is an EMA (`sat_cap_tau_s`).

  Both halves were measured. The first version latched: the corpus
  frame-to-frame step at engagement was 0.032 1/m at p90 against 0.0006 in
  ordinary driving, so the corridor radius halved in one frame, visible in the
  debug view and enough to step filter regimes across their kappa thresholds.
  Dropping the confirm window and letting the ratio drive `w` on its own fixed
  the step (p90 0.0050) but capped on turn-in transients, where the measurement
  window still trails the wheel: clips that merely brushed the cap went from 3
  to 61 of 405, and the corpus went from 4 better / 3 worse to 5 better / 7
  worse. Confirm plus ramp keeps the selectivity (3 of 405) at a p90 step of
  0.0071, and the while-capped jitter at 0.0025 from 0.0088. Scaling `w` across
  the ratio band instead of arming all-or-nothing was also measured and
  rejected: it capped mild under-turn (ratio 0.75 to 0.85) that the latch never
  took, which is what cost `e0fd28b3`, the clip `oncoming_closing_lat_m` exists
  to recover.

  **Two lag traps sit either side of the detector, and both were live:**

  - The **ratio** compares a yaw delta across the window against the command.
    Tested against the instantaneous steer, a fast wind-on reads as understeer,
    because the wheel has already moved on. It reads `_kappa_cmd_ref`, the
    command averaged over that same window, so the comparison is like for like.
  - The **cap value** smooths downward only (`max(ema, raw)`). Into a tightening
    corner both the window and the EMA trail the real line, and a cap under it
    points the corridor at traffic the truck is already curving around.

The **rule**: measured curvature may only lower the magnitude while saturation
is confirmed. It never raises it, never flips its sign, and never replaces the
steer term in the linear regime, so unwinding the wheel and counter-steering
still reach the corridor on the same frame. Do not add an "optional" history
fallback beyond that cap: the reactivity loss is the problem, not the
transient-sample count.

The rule binds the published value too: `EgoPathState.kappa_cap` is set only
while `sat_weight > 0`. Unarmed, the EMA is just the measured line within
`sat_cap_margin` of what the truck is doing anyway, and a consumer that reads
it as a ceiling bounds its arcs to the turn ego is already in. That is how it
reached the evasion corridor: over a 200 clip sample it bit 78.1% of moving
frames, 98.5% of them with the tires in their linear range, and 22.3% of
frames lost both escape arcs at once.

The learner and the cap split on lateral load, and that split is load-bearing:
underperformance below `ego_path_learn_max_lat_ms2` is geometry, so the gain
adapts; underperformance above `ego_path_sat_min_lat_ms2` is grip, so the cap
takes it and the gain is left alone. Without it a single understeering corner
would teach the model that the truck steers badly everywhere.

Clips never record the learned gain (a new clip field bumps `CONSENT_VERSION`),
so replay re-derives it with `clip_replay.ego_path_replay`, which runs the
learner over the whole clip before the first tick. Live has been learning for
far longer than an 11 second window; starting replay from the prior would
replay a colder model than the one that made the recorded decisions.

### What it did to the corpus

Measured 2026-09-21 over 2225 clips (1144 labelled, ignore and unlabelled excluded),
against today's fixed-gain path with no cap:

| | clips whose stream moved | better | worse |
|---|---|---|---|
| grip cap only | 149 (6.7%) | 5 | 5 |
| cap + learned gain | 647 (29.1%) | 10 | 8 |

**No true positive is lost in either column.** Better is two false negatives recovered
(`6adac35a` and `7b945148`, both crash clips) plus false positives becoming true
negatives; worse is entirely "brakes where the label says it should not", on clips
labelled `fp` or `tn`.

Every flip opened by hand came down the same way: the old corridor was up to three times
more curved than the line the truck actually held, and that error was sweeping the
corridor off targets by accident in both directions. On `84cdd6b3` the truck was on a
114 m radius at 91 km/h with a 22.5 km/h vehicle 33 m dead ahead, and the driver steered
around it a second later; on `d16d0575` a lead at 0.74 s headway decelerating 1.5 m/s^2
was held out of lane. An accurate path hands both decisions back to AEB's own threat and
evasion logic, which is where they belong. Read a verdict drop here as that class
surfacing rather than as a regression on its own: the corpus windows were hand-tagged
against the old corridor.

`RadarData.ego_curvature` is consumed by ACC, not AEB.

### Target-vehicle curvature: two-source blend

Per-target arc curvature is computed by `_vehicle_curvature_blend()` in
`filters.py`. AEB-local two-source path prediction combines:

| Signal | Source | Role |
|--------|--------|------|
| `pos_kappa` | `ego_curvature_from_history` on the last `cal.aeb_pos_history_len = 6` samples of `v._position_history` (shorter than the full 25-sample fit used elsewhere) | **Smooth**: damps single-frame yaw noise |
| `yaw_kappa` | `radians(v.angular_velocity) / abs_v_speed`: per-frame yaw rate already maintained by the radar thread | **Responsive**: single-frame rotation signal |

```python
if pos_kappa is not None and yaw_kappa is not None:
    v_curvature = cal.aeb_yaw_blend * yaw_kappa + (1 - cal.aeb_yaw_blend) * pos_kappa
elif pos_kappa is not None:
    v_curvature = pos_kappa
elif yaw_kappa is not None:
    v_curvature = yaw_kappa
else:
    v_curvature = 0.0
```

`aeb_yaw_blend` (default `0.4`) controls the mix. This produces
`v_curvature`, the raw measured curvature used by same-curve and diverge
filters. Arcs built for prediction use `arc_curvature`, which is `v_curvature`
after Fix D over-rotation damping when that damping applies. Visualization and
collision must use the same `arc_curvature` so the debug view matches what AEB
actually evaluates. Call sites that go through the helper:

1. `thread.py::_build_vehicle_collision_data` (precompute path): collision tractor + trailer
2. `thread.py::loop` (per-vehicle else branch): visualization, deriving `arc_curvature` from `_dampen_turning_curvature(...)`, then passing it to `v.get_arc(...)` and trailer `build_arc(...)`
3. `filters.py::_build_vehicle_collision_data` (test harness path): collision tractor + trailer

`LaneClassifier.apply` does **not** recompute `v_curvature`: the upstream
call sites above populate it on the `FilterContext` once per frame and the
stage reads it as-is. Recomputing there would double-step the One-Euro state
(see below).

### One-Euro post-filter on `v_curvature`

The yaw+pos blend is fed through a per-vehicle One-Euro filter
(`VehicleCurvatureBlender` in `filters.py`) before reaching the pipeline.
Speed-adaptive low-pass: cutoff = `min_cutoff + beta · |dkappa/dt|`. Quiet
steady state → heavy smoothing (kills single-frame jitter). Genuine corner
entry → cutoff jumps with the derivative and the filter approaches
passthrough within a frame. Reference: Casiez et al., "1€ Filter", CHI 2012.

State lives on `AEBThread._curvature_blender`, keyed by `vehicle.id`. The
helper is stepped exactly once per vehicle per frame: first call site that
sees the vehicle (precompute or fallback else branch in the per-vehicle
loop) advances the filter; `LaneClassifier` reads the cached value from
`ctx.v_curvature`. The blender is `prune`d at the end of each loop against
the current `vehicles_eff` id set so disappearing targets release state.

Calibration:

| Knob | Default | Role |
|------|---------|------|
| `aeb_kappa_one_euro_min_cutoff` | 1.0 Hz | Smooth-floor cutoff at zero derivative |
| `aeb_kappa_one_euro_beta` | 200.0 | Slope of cutoff vs `|dkappa/dt|`: higher = snappier transient, lets more noise through |
| `aeb_kappa_one_euro_d_cutoff` | 1.0 Hz | Low-pass on the derivative estimate (rejects noise-driven cutoff swings) |
| `aeb_kappa_one_euro_beta_turn_scale` | 30.0 | Progressive beta attenuation with `\|kappa\|`: `beta_eff = beta / (1 + scale * \|x_prev\|)`. Counters in-turn cutoff inflation from magnitude-scaling noise (yaw_rate/v amplification, pos-fit numerical sensitivity). 0 disables |

When `_vehicle_curvature_blend()` is called without a blender (e.g. test
paths that don't carry filter state across frames), it returns the raw
blended value. Production paths in `AEBThread` always pass the blender.

Never call `v.get_arc()` from AEB without a `curvature_override`: the
fallback inside `traffic.py::get_arc` uses the full 25-sample
`curvature_from_history()` fit, which lags exiting a corner and leaves
the tractor arc curved long after the trailer arc has straightened.

Do not enlarge `aeb_pos_history_len` toward 25: the responsiveness gain
is the whole point, and `curvature_from_history()` on the full buffer is
what ACC uses.

## 2. Module layout

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `core/aeb/calibration.py` | Frozen `AEBCalibration` dataclass: all tunable constants. `DEFAULT` singleton used by both `thread.py` and tests. |
| `core/aeb/lane_frame.py` | `Lane` enum, `project_to_ego_arc()`, `classify()`: arc-projected lane membership, replacing the old cross-product `lateral_offset`. Also the body-in-lane primitives (`_any_body_in_ego_lane`, `_body_centreline_d_abs`). |
| `core/aeb/filters.py` | Named filter pipeline: 12 stage classes + `FilterContext` + `build_pipeline()`. |
| `core/aeb/thread.py` | `AEBThread`: data acquisition, ego-arc construction, pipeline dispatch, TTB/state output. |

---

## 3. Filter pipeline

`build_pipeline(cal)` returns the ordered list of stage instances. Each stage
exposes `.apply(ctx) -> FilterResult`. The first stage that returns
`suppressed=True` short-circuits and the vehicle is skipped. If all stages
pass, the vehicle enters collision evaluation.

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `RangeFilter` | Distance gate (`cal.max_range`) |
| `ElevationFilter` | Membership in radar's `off_surface_ids` (core/radar/README.md §15) |
| `LowSpeedTrailerFilter` | Trailers while ego is below `cal.trailer_ignore_below_kmh` |
| `TmpRelSpeedFilter` | TMP session relative-speed pre-filter |
| `LaneClassifier` | Populates `ctx` geometry fields; sets `ctx.lane` via `lane_frame` |
| `OppositeLaneFilter` | Oncoming vehicles in their own lane (collapses Fix A + Fix B) |
| `CoDirectionalDivergeFilter` | Co-directional arcs already diverging (Fix C + outer-lane same-turn) |
| `TurningCrossTrafficFilter` | Cross-traffic turning through intersection (Fix D absorbed) |
| `OutOfLaneParallelFilter` | Capsule lane-keeping adjacent / roadside traffic; also rear overtakers |
| `TmpCrossTrafficFilter` | TMP-only: straight snapshot uses centre closest-approach (T-bone vs body-graze), turning snapshot uses measured centre-contact rescue before endpoint lane |
| `SweepPassFilter` | Stationary cross-traffic ego turns through |
| `CornerEntryStationaryFilter` | Stationary at corner entry: out-of-lane oncoming/co-dir, or in-lane with arc consistency |
| `EgoEvasionFilter` | Ego can steer around target within 0.08 g (runs for `Lane.EGO` too) |

`FilterContext.d_miss` carries the measured CBDR miss for the vehicle, computed
once per vehicle per frame by the `los_miss` memo in `thread.py::loop`. It is
`None` when the track is too short; filters must fail open on `None`.

Fix labels A/B/C/D are retired: the logic now lives in the named stages above.

The legacy `RearOvertakerFilter` was retired in favour of a unified
"braking worsens" classification in the collision-evaluation step (see §5).
That check compares closing-speed magnitude under braked vs unbraked
trajectories and subsumes the rear-overtaker case along with cross-traffic
scenarios where braking parks ego in a target's path.

### `LowSpeedTrailerFilter`

Suppresses `is_trailer` targets that sit **behind the cab** while
`|ego_speed|` is under `cal.trailer_ignore_below_kmh` (20 km/h), in both
directions of travel. Coupling drives the truck under a trailer on purpose:
backing on to the fifth wheel and pulling out from under a dropped one are
the same geometry at manoeuvring speed, and the trailer body is inside the
ego capsule by design. No geometric test separates that from a threat,
because it *is* an intentional collision course.

Two details are load-bearing:

- The behind test uses the **body frame** (`-dx sin(yaw) - dz cos(yaw)`), not
  `ctx.ego_fwd_*`. That pair flips with travel direction (`build_arc`
  normalises reversing to positive speed), so a trailer being backed under
  would read as "ahead" and pass.
- Trailers **ahead** of the cab are never touched. Rolling into the back of a
  parked trailer at 10-15 km/h is a labelled TP class in the corpus
  (`1df08197`, `ced27cc6`, `84fafd65`, `541030ee`, `3fc7738c`, `4ba23e1c`);
  a blanket low-speed trailer ignore turned all six into misses for +143
  corpus points.

Latched ids bypass the stage, so an event that engaged above the floor keeps
its pipeline seat and runs to completion instead of releasing the brake as
ego decelerates through 20 km/h.

Corpus: -324.00 to -342.30 over 784 clips. FP 40 to 34, TP and FN unchanged.
The six cleared are `c6595282`, `08223dda`, `db1ae7e7`, `97f813ce`,
`b295e45f`, `638920e7`, plus a partial on `aeaa0d6c`.

### `LaneClassifier`: canonical lane primitive

`LaneClassifier` is the first stage to populate all geometry fields. It uses
`project_to_ego_arc()` from `core/aeb/lane_frame.py` to compute the arc-projected
lateral offset. For curved ego arcs, the returned `d_abs` is the **maximum** of
the circle-offset and the straight-line heading offset. This prevents a tight ego
turn from projecting an opposite-lane vehicle into the EGO bucket.

Lane thresholds (`cal.lane_half_width=1.95 m`, `cal.lane_separation=3.9 m`):

| d_abs | Lane |
|-------|------|
| ≤ 1.95 m | `EGO` |
| 1.95–1.95 m | `ADJACENT` (empty range: no ADJACENT in practice) |
| 1.95–7.8 m | `OPPOSITE_OR_OUTER` |
| > 7.8 m | `OFF_ROAD` |

### Travel frame: reversing targets

Target arcs have always moved along the direction of travel (`ArcPath.build` flips
`fwd` for negative speed), but the regime flags that choose which filters apply
(`head_on`, `near_head_on`, `co_directional`) were read off the **heading**. A
reversing truck therefore sat in a regime that contradicted its own arc:

- Clip d80936f9: a TMP truck facing ego at an angle (heading `fwd_dot` -0.67)
  backed across ego's lane at 2.9 m/s. The heading frame called it oncoming in
  its own lane, so `OppositeLaneFilter` and the 3.9 m head-on lateral gap
  dropped it and the arc assumed it would stop at `full_brake_decel`. At 40 km/h
  that clip stays silent by design (the TMP rel-speed floor, §4); at road speed
  the same pose is scenario `tp_reversing_truck_backs_across_path`.
- Clip 66874532: a rig heading ego's way (`fwd_dot` +0.85) backed diagonally into
  ego's lane at 4.5 m/s. The heading frame got that one right by accident: it
  read co-directional, which is the one class that was not wrong for it.

The rule has two halves, and both are needed:

1. **Regimes follow travel.** `travel_sign(v.speed, cal)` is -1 once the signed
   speed is below `-cal.reversing_speed_ms` (1.0 m/s, the same line
   `sweep_pass_max_target_speed` draws for "stationary"), and `fwd_dot` is taken
   against the travel direction everywhere a regime is decided: `LaneClassifier`,
   the collision-data helper (both copies), Fix D damping, follow-threat and
   `clip_replay`. Products that turn `fwd_dot` back into a velocity use
   `ctx.v_travel_speed`, so `speed * fwd_dot` keeps meaning velocity along ego.
   Target velocity itself stays `v.speed * heading`, which was always right.
2. **A reversing target is never oncoming.** `head_on` and `near_head_on` are
   forced false for it. Every oncoming rule models a driver proceeding along a
   road who can see ego: `OppositeLaneFilter` (keeps its lane or steers away),
   the head-on lateral gap (§8), the full-brake target arc, the oncoming risk
   and warn persistence windows, and the head-on LOS bar. None of that
   describes a truck backing up. Travel frame alone moved 66874532 into
   `OppositeLaneFilter` and turned a severity-4 TP into a miss; the scenario
   `tp_reversing_rig_backs_into_lane` pins the warn time that exposes it.

`TmpCrossTrafficFilter` also skips reversing targets by name: it models a TMP
driver sweeping through a junction. **`TmpRelSpeedFilter` does not.** Exempting
reversing targets from the floor made d80936f9 brake and would bring back the
low-speed TMP false positives the floor exists for; the travel frame is for
reversing traffic that clears the floor, not a way around it. Geometric
stages (`CoDirectionalDivergeFilter`, `TurningCrossTrafficFilter`,
`OutOfLaneParallelFilter`, `EgoEvasionFilter`) run unchanged in the travel frame.

`_body_centreline_d_abs` samples along the heading (`arc.yaw_rad`), not
`arc.fwd_*`: capsule extents are heading-relative, so the travel `fwd` mirrored
the samples off a reversing body. `TmpCrossTrafficFilter`'s sweep arc is rebuilt
with the sign of `v.speed`, since `ArcPath.speed` is stored as `|speed|`.

The radar side of the same clip is in `core/radar/README.md` (position
mismatch): before it, a reversing TMP vehicle was frozen 5 frames in 6 and read at
about half its speed, so none of the above could see it clearly anyway.

**Measured** (pre-change baseline -> radar run rule plus travel frame, 810 local /
491 remote clips): local -386.93 -> -421.15, remote +358.71 -> +326.27. Misses to
TP: 5f0da738, 0a5eacdc; 9cc70333 miss to late; 4cb90214, 626d28b6 and 888b45fd FP
to silent, a823f720 false warn to silent. No verdict got worse. ebb1e8cf (labelled
FP for parked bodies) brakes 0.9 s longer, on a real TMP truck reversing across
ego's path about 6 m ahead.

### `OppositeLaneFilter`

Applies to `head_on` vehicles (`fwd_dot < cal.head_on_dot=-0.7`), and to
`near_head_on` for the **body-separation** fast path only (collide can start
before `fd` crosses `head_on_dot`).

1. Lane check: `own_lane = ctx.lane in (OPPOSITE_OR_OUTER, OFF_ROAD)`
2. Body-separation fast path: if pose `d_abs >= clear_bar - oncoming_body_sep_soft_m`
   and the measured miss agrees, suppress (also when lane reads `EGO` under the
   soft bar: corner-pull adjacent). Skip when `oncoming_closing_into` (below)
   or when `max_evasion_lat_g` refuses (physically unavoidable closing). Opp
   arms max-g refuse at 7 m by default; targets ≥ `max_evasion_opp_fast_kmh`
   (60) use the lower `max_evasion_min_lat_m_opp_fast` (4.5) arm.
3. Evasion arc test (`head_on` only): for each target arc, build two curvature-offset arcs
   (`base_curvature ± delta_kappa_t`, `decel=0`). If either clears `ego_arc`, suppress.
   - `delta_kappa_t = min(evasion_g_oncoming / v², evasion_max_dkappa)`, scaled by
     `opposite_lane_kappa_scale` when `own_lane`.
   - Fix B: `delta_kappa_t = max(delta_kappa_t, min(|ego_curvature|, shared_turn_max_kappa))`
     when `own_lane` and ego is turning, **except** when CBDR miss is closing
     fast while ego turns (below).

**Turn-into-path (CBDR miss rate).** Ego steering into oncoming can inflate
arc `d_abs` while the measured miss shrinks (clip `e0fd28b3`: `d_miss` rate
about −5.6 m/s). Closing predicate: `|ego_curvature| >= turning_diverge_kappa`,
`d_miss_rate <= oncoming_closing_dmiss_rate_mps` (−1.5 m/s), straight-frame
`|lat| < oncoming_closing_lat_m` (0.85 m), and arc inflation
`d_abs >= |lat| * oncoming_closing_dabs_lat_ratio` (honest adjacent stays
body-sep; turn-into with inflated `d_abs` still skips). On that course skip
body-sep and Fix B κ expansion; also skip engagement-entry LOS / turn
extrapolation vetoes so warn can promote to brake. Evasion clearance still may
suppress. Colliding closing targets also earn `certain_geom` for instant engage.
`OppositeLaneFilterMirrored` stays `Lane.EGO` only.

**Shared bend beats the `|lat|` collapse.** `|lat|` is measured against ego's
straight-ahead axis, so mid-corner it sweeps through zero on *every* oncoming
pass while the arc offset stays a full lane wide. That is what made clip
`7d76e26d` brake: `d_abs` held 6.95 m against a 2.46 m body bar for the whole
approach, and the only signal that disagreed was `|lat|` grazing 0.16 m for four
ticks. `lane_frame.shares_bend` exits the predicate first: the target must be turning
(`|v_curvature| >= turning_diverge_kappa`) at `oncoming_shared_bend_ratio` (0.5)
or more of ego's `|κ|`, which says it is following the same road and the wide
arc offset is real rather than ego's held steer extrapolated. Measured ratios:
`7d76e26d` 0.73-0.97 and `458b8166` 0.97-1.07 on the bend, against 0.00-0.04 for
the turn-into TP `e0fd28b3`, whose oncoming target runs straight (`|v_curvature|`
under 0.002) while ego turns at 0.05-0.06.

**No sign test, deliberately.** Two vehicles meeting on one bend usually carry
*opposite*-signed curvature, because each signs its own travel direction: over
the corpus, 89.8% of head-on ticks with both vehicles turning inside 40 m are
opposite-signed (n=34154). Requiring agreement would miss most real shared
bends, and requiring disagreement would miss `7d76e26d` itself, which is
same-signed. The magnitude ratio carries the whole test and stays correct under
either convention. `CoDirectionalDivergeFilter` Fix C does use a sign test, but
it compares co-directional traffic, where both vehicles sign the same way.

### `CoDirectionalDivergeFilter`

Applies only to `co_directional` vehicles (`fwd_dot > cal.co_directional_dot=0.7`).
For each arc with `speed > 0.5 m/s` evaluate `_is_approaching` at the hit point
(lookahead `co_dir_diverge_lookahead_s=0.25 s`). **Suppress only when every
colliding body of the rig diverges** (the first approaching arc passes the rig):
a tractor pulling into the outer lane genuinely diverges, but if its trailer is
still closing in ego's lane the rig is a real rear-end course, and vetoing on the
cab arc (evaluated first) would drop the approaching trailer with it (crash clip
434f0401).
Extended lookahead (`dynamic_horizon × co_same_turn_lookahead_scale=0.5`) when
all four conditions hold: vehicle in outer lane, both curvatures above threshold,
same curvature sign.

**Trailer-in-lane rescue.** The lane primitive (`ctx.lane`) keys off the tractor
reference point only, so a long trailer swung across ego's lane while its tractor
rides the outer lane of a shared curve reads as EGO-lane-clear: the extended
lookahead then extrapolates the whole rig away as "diverging" and suppresses a
genuine rear-end until the cab crosses into ego's lane at contact (crash clip
434f0401). `_any_body_in_ego_lane` samples each arc's rigid body capsule
centreline (rear→front) at `t=0`; when any body is physically inside
`lane_half_width`, the same-turn extended lookahead is dropped and the in-lane
dip check is armed. The centreline (no body half-width) is used so a
corridor-grazing outer-lane body is not miscounted as in-lane
(`fp_co_directional_outer_lane` stays suppressed). Regression scenario:
`tp_trailer_in_lane_shared_curve`. The same primitive gates the equivalent
tractor-based lane checks in `OutOfLaneParallelFilter` and `EgoEvasionFilter`.

**Pass-through dip check (in-lane only).** The `_is_approaching` endpoint
comparison alone inverts for fast closers: the hit time is the capsule
contact moment (bumper gap ≈ the effective corridor margin since the
cap-alignment fix), so a modest closing speed already carries the `t + dt`
sample beyond the target, center distance grows again, and a lead about to
be rear-ended reads as "diverging" (FN clip fbc397b3: 97 km/h ego suppressed
a 20 km/h in-lane lead until impact, back when the padded contact distance
still put the inversion near ~70 km/h closing). Fix:
`_is_approaching` samples `cal.diverge_dip_samples` points across the
window; when `dip_active` and any sample's center distance drops below the
sum of the body half-widths (no corridor margin), the extrapolated bodies
overlap and the pair counts as approaching regardless of the endpoints.
`dip_active` is `ctx.lane == Lane.EGO` in `TurningCrossTrafficFilter`, and
`ctx.lane == Lane.EGO or in_lane_body` in this stage (see the trailer-in-lane
rescue above): for out-of-lane targets with no body in ego's lane an
extrapolated body overlap is usually a constant-curvature artifact (e.g.
overtaking a slower outer-lane vehicle in a shared turn:
`fp_co_directional_outer_lane`), which is exactly what the filter exists to
suppress. Regression scenario: `tp_fast_closing_lead` (80 km/h closing, in-lane).

### `OutOfLaneParallelFilter`

Suppresses co-directional / stationary traffic whose body stays out of ego's
lane: the capsule collision body registers a grazing corridor overlap for a
long vehicle driving or parked alongside ego that the point model mostly
missed. A target whose centre never enters ego's lane over the horizon
(arc-projected offset stays above `lane_half_width`) is lane-keeping adjacent
traffic or a roadside object, not a collision course. Head-on own-lane
oncoming is handled by `OppositeLaneFilter`; follow / latched threats and any
body sample already in the EGO band (trailer swung into path, clip 434f0401)
are exempt.

**Stationary adjacent straddle.** An angled parked body can put the reference
pose (or a shallow centreline graze) in `Lane.EGO` while the far end sits in
the adjacent lane (clip `82acb8e8`: samples ~1.0–3.5 m). When
`min(d_abs)` in `(stationary_ool_graze_min_m, stationary_ool_graze_max_m]` and
`max(d_abs)` in `[lane_half_width * stationary_ool_span_scale, lane_separation]`,
suppress as roadside. Stationary centre scans also use `v.position` instead of the
body-offset `arc.start`, which otherwise fakes an in-lane centre.

**Rear-overtaker early suppress.** Faster co-directional traffic approaching
from behind in another lane (`v·ego_fwd > ego_speed` and `dx·ego_fwd < 0`) is
suppressed *before* the predicted-centre scan. That scan is circular: it
projects onto the same bent ego arc that manufactures the phantom capsule
hit, so it leaks exactly on the wiggle ticks that create the FP (passing
clips f0b2ace6 / 02642609). A genuine cut-in brings its body into the EGO
band and is not suppressed here; braking_worsens covers the same class if
anything still reaches collision eval.

### `TmpCrossTrafficFilter`

TMP-only filter that absorbs MP-data uncertainty for routine intersection
maneuvers. TMP position/yaw/curvature snapshots are jittered enough that an
in-progress turn at a side road can briefly project an arc through ego's lane
even though the actual MP target is sweeping past. Applies to TMP vehicles
(`v.is_tmp=True`) that aren't co-directional and have non-trivial speed. For
each target arc with a collision hit, build a non-braked "sweep" arc from the
snapshot's `(start, yaw, curvature, speed)`, then branch on how trustworthy
the snapshot's motion is (`ctx.v_curvature`):

- **Straight snapshot** (`|v_curvature| < turning_diverge_kappa`): the motion
  is trustworthy, so decide on the geometry directly. Take the closest approach
  of the two reference **centres** over the horizon (ego arc vs sweep arc). If
  they genuinely meet (`d_min <= cal.tmp_cross_center_hit_dist`) it is a real
  T-bone → **pass** (brake). If the centres miss (the collision is only the
  target's long body grazing ego's corridor as it sweeps clear) → **suppress**.
- **Turning snapshot** (`|v_curvature| >= turning_diverge_kappa`): the jittered
  curvature makes the predicted centre path unreliable, so keep the full-horizon
  endpoint-lane test. Endpoint in `OPPOSITE_OR_OUTER` / `OFF_ROAD` → the target
  sweeps clear → **suppress**; endpoint in `Lane.EGO` → real continuing threat →
  **pass**. Before suppressing, a centre encounter within
  `tmp_cross_center_hit_dist` passes when the measured CBDR miss is within the
  combined body half-widths and its measured rate is non-positive. Both measured
  values must exist; an unknown track or an opening miss keeps the endpoint test.

The split fixes a false negative in the old design, which used the endpoint
test for **all** TMP cross-traffic. The endpoint answers "where does the target
*end up* at the 3 s horizon", not "does it occupy ego's lane *when ego
arrives*". A genuine straight perpendicular crosser on a dead-center collision
course always ends tens of metres past ego's lane at the endpoint, so it was
suppressed at every range (no warn, no brake in TMP sessions until the crosser's
measured speed dropped: corpus FN clip ffd29f9e). The centre-miss test answers
the correct question for the trustworthy straight case: a real collision brings
the reference centres to ~0 m, a body-only graze keeps them metres apart. The
turning branch retains its endpoint test unless a measured closing collision
corroborates the sweep, and still suppresses the mid-turn jitter phantom
(regression `fp_tmp_side_road_right_turn` phase 2, `fp_cross_traffic_completing_turn`).

Clip ceadfde4 and its matching video show a crossing rig occupying the lane,
not a roadside vehicle. The previous turning endpoint test discarded centre
contacts before the target cleared the lane. Recorded-input replay moves the
first brake from 4.500 s to 3.594 s with the measured-contact rescue. The seven
other supplied clips retain their first-brake times and brake-tick counts;
existing roadside false brakes are not fixed by this change. Replay does not
simulate the changed ego trajectory, so it does not prove collision avoidance.

Optional `tmp_cross_in_corridor_pass`: when enabled, do not graze-suppress if the
body is already inside `|lat| ≤ lane_half_width` ahead with a closing (or unknown)
miss rate. Default off: max_evasion fail-closed covers the hard TMP twins without
the side-road FP cost. `max_evasion_lat_g` also refuses TmpCross suppress when
straight-frame `|lat|` clears `max_evasion_min_lat_m_tmp_cross` (3 m; Opp
uses the higher 7 m arm) and required lateral accel exceeds the truck
budget (physically unavoidable closing).

No imminence / TTB floor is used: the turning phantom persists to `hit ≈ 0`
(the jittered vehicle sweeps through ego's lane right up to closest approach),
so any positive "never suppress below this hit time" floor would leak that
regression. A turning TMP target that is genuinely on a collision course and
close-in relies on the engagement-certainty gate + TTB slam net downstream, not
this stage.

Uses a freshly-built non-braking arc from the **undamped** `ctx.v_curvature`
(rather than `base_target_arc`) in both branches: the standard arc may be
truncated by target-side full-brake modeling at near-head-on angles, and its
Fix D over-rotation damping straightens the arc of a target genuinely sweeping
through a corner. Either one distorts the projected centre path and endpoint and
masks where the cross-traffic actually sweeps to.

Non-TMP targets bypass entirely: AI vehicles' arcs are deterministic and
already handled by `OppositeLaneFilter`, `TurningCrossTrafficFilter`, etc.
Reversing targets bypass too: the stage models a driver sweeping through a
junction, and its centre-miss graze test suppressed a rig backing into ego's lane.

### `CornerEntryStationaryFilter`

Suppresses stationary targets (`|speed| < sweep_pass_max_target_speed`) at
corner *entry* (`|ego_curvature| < turning_diverge_kappa`) when their pose
implies they sit on a curved road continuation rather than blocking ego's
straight-line path.

- Symmetric road-bend formula: `road_bend = acos(|fwd_dot|)`: folds oncoming
  (`fwd_dot ≈ -1`) and co-directional (`fwd_dot ≈ +1`) cases into `[0, π/2]`.
- Implied curvature `road_bend / dist` must exceed `turning_diverge_kappa`.
- **Mode A** (out-of-lane): vehicle in `OPPOSITE_OR_OUTER`/`OFF_ROAD` → suppress.
  Covers the original "around the bend" oncoming case, now also co-directional.
- **Mode B** (in-lane): vehicle in `Lane.EGO` → require geometric consistency
  with a curved continuation. Yaw-rotation direction must match lateral-offset
  direction, and `|dist · sin(road_bend / 2) − |lat_signed||` must fall within
  `corner_entry_lateral_tol`. Catches MP stopped queues whose lead vehicle
  projects to ego's straight axis but whose pose only makes sense on a curve.
- Latched ids skip **Mode B** (`lane == EGO`). Mode A's out-of-lane queue
  must stay suppressed even if a graze latched the id.
  Mode B's `implied_kappa = road_bend / dist` grows as range falls, so a few
  degrees of yaw error that was legal at 40 m fires at 17 m while AEB is
  already braking. Do not add an in-lane bypass here: Mode B *is* the in-lane
  case (`fp_mp_stationary_corner_entry`). `CornerEntryStationaryFilterMirrored`
  is Mode A. Follow-threat ids do pass it: a stopped in-path cut-in can sit in
  `OPPOSITE_OR_OUTER` while occupying the corridor (clip `c3c7a529`, d_abs ~4 m
  at bite).
- **A braked-for body still in ego's lane is never dropped** (Mode A, both
  stages). The lane bucket keys off the reference point, so a long or angled
  body whose centre reads `OPPOSITE_OR_OUTER` can still reach ego's lane. A
  latched id with a body centreline sample inside `lane_half_width` and ahead
  of ego's front (`_latched_body_in_lane`, shared with four more stages; see
  the latched-threat hold) passes Mode A; a queue whose body stays out of the
  band is still suppressed when latched.
  Without it the stage dropped the vehicle AEB was braking for whenever
  `|ego_curvature|` crossed `turning_diverge_kappa` mid-event: clip `da5dee09`
  released at 48 km/h 14 m short of a stopped truck (0.97 m off ego's driven
  line), and `16e65bcc` released for 0.27 s at 80 km/h. The headway hold
  removed in `59cc071` used to mask this. Measured over 2642 clips, releases
  above 20 km/h of a body on ego's recorded driven line fell 17 to 4
  (`CornerEntryStationaryFilter`) and 14 to 9 (`...Mirrored`), with no verdict
  change and no new engagement. **Entry is deliberately unchanged**: applying
  the same body test before engagement rescued two misses but braked for seven
  parked trailers and cars whose bodies reach the band at the roadside. The
  remaining Mirrored drops are mid-turn targets on ego's curved path, which
  `project_to_ego_arc`'s `max(d_arc, d_straight)` reads as out of lane.

### `EgoEvasionFilter`

After all previous stages pass, checks if ego could steer around the target
within `evasion_g=0.08 g`. Uses `margin=0.0` for evasion arc checks (physical
body clearance, not padded corridor).

**The escape arcs and the grip cap.** `thread.py::_evasion_kappas` offsets the
ego path by `delta_kappa = min(evasion_g / v², evasion_max_dkappa)` on each
side. While `EgoPathModel` has saturation confirmed, the arc that turns
*tighter* than the line ego holds may only spend the grip left over
(`cap - |kappa_path|`), so a truck already at the ceiling has no tighter escape
route. The arc that unwinds asks for less curvature than the path and is never
limited; in the linear regime neither is. The allowance fades with
`sat_weight` rather than switching, because clamping outright on the arming
frame stepped the corridor edge 1.8x as far as the path under it.

**`ctx.lane == Lane.EGO` by itself never bypasses this stage.** Lane-EGO
classification is not evidence of danger: stationary shoulder vehicles and
passing traffic on wide or curved roads land in the EGO bucket routinely, and
a target a 0.08 g steer clears is not a threat whatever bucket it sits in.
The in-lane closer bypass below uses the straight body frame (`|lat|`, axial,
closing), not the lane bucket, because a parked truck's arc origin inflates
`d_abs` into `OPPOSITE_OR_OUTER` while the body is still dead ahead.

| Bypass | Condition | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Latched threat | `v.id in latched_threat_ids` | Mid-brake hold. Dropping the vehicle AEB is already braking for empties `colliding_ids` and collapses demand. Same seat as `OutOfLaneParallelFilter`. |
| In-lane closer | ahead, straight `\|lat\| <= lane_half_width`, closing `> aeb_min_closing_ms` (1.0), and co-directional or stationary | Pre-brake rescue for a lead in the lane band. Weak closing stays on the 0.08 g check. Shoulder FPs sit outside the band (`fp_parked_shoulder` x=2.2). |
| Head-on | `head_on` **and** target moving | Oncoming traffic belongs to `OppositeLaneFilter`, which runs its own evasion arcs at `evasion_g_oncoming`. A *stationary* target facing ego is a parked obstacle, not oncoming, so it runs the check unless the in-lane closer bypass already took it. |
| Trailer swing | out-of-lane co-directional mover with a body inside `lane_half_width` | Genuine rear-end course; crash clip 434f0401 must never be evasion-suppressed. This is the one place the trailer-in-lane rescue is deliberately *stronger* than `Lane.EGO`. |
| Follow-threat | `v.id in follow_threat_ids` **and** `ref_kmh_for_filter <= tmp_filter_split_kmh` | Inside the low-speed TMP band `TmpRelSpeedFilter` drops targets unless relative speed exceeds `tmp_filter_rel_below_kmh`, which discards real low-speed dangers; the behavioral latch is the fallback there. Above the split the latch is ACC-shaped lead tracking, which does not establish danger, so it no longer shields a target. |

Do not change the OR-of-sides rule (suppress if *either* 0.08 g arc misses)
into AND: that re-opens the shoulder FP class the 0.08 g filter exists for.

## 4. TMP rel-speed pre-filter

When **any** slot in the frame has `is_tmp`, AEB pre-filters targets by
**‖v_ego − v_target‖** (km/h) vs a **reference ego speed**:

- ref **> 50 km/h** → threat only if rel **> 15 km/h**
- ref **≤ 50 km/h** → threat only if rel **> 50 km/h**

These are the effective bars of two stacked gates that carry different
constants. The collision precompute in `thread.py` (`_tmp_collision_threat`:
split 40, rel > 15 above it, rel > 40 at or below) skips a target before its
arcs are built, and `TmpRelSpeedFilter` (`tmp_filter_split_kmh` 50,
`tmp_filter_rel_above_kmh` 5, `tmp_filter_rel_below_kmh` 50) suppresses it in
the pipeline. A target must pass both, so the 15 km/h bar comes from the
precompute and the 50 km/h split and bar from the filter;
`tmp_filter_rel_above_kmh` and the precompute's two 40s never bind. Moving one
copy alone shifts only part of the band. Latched and follow-threat ids skip
both gates.

Reversing targets get no exemption. The floor keeps d80936f9 (a truck backing across
ego's lane at 35 km/h relative) silent on purpose: exempting them re-opens the low-speed
TMP false positives the floor was added for. See the travel frame section.

Reference is current ego speed unless **latched**: the first frame with
`AEBState ≥ WARN` or addressing brake (`_read_addressing_brake`: driver pedal
or CC/ACC program brake above the 0.03 deadzone, not OPD coast-down) saves
`ego_kmh`;
latch held until state drops below WARN **and** brake released; cleared when
the session is no longer TMP.

## 5. AEB Thread Interface

Read from other threads (acquire `data._lock` first):

```python
aeb = registry.get_thread("aeb_thread").data
aeb.AEB_warn                       # bool: UI cue (warn fraction or TTB); sound is warn OR brake
aeb.AEB_brake                      # bool: engagement latched and target > 0

```

### Continuous-decel logic

1. Pipeline runs as before. First `suppressed=True` short-circuits.
2. For surviving targets: collision check yields `unbraked_hit` and
   `braked_hit`. Per-target `closing_speed` is the **vector magnitude** of
   the relative velocity in world frame (`|v_ego_vec − v_target_vec|`), not
   the axial projection onto ego's heading. The axial form clamps to zero
   for rear-overtakers and misses the rear-end-worsens case.
   - `braking_worsens` is set if either:
     - `braked_hit is not None` and (`v_target_along_ego > ego_speed`
       — pure rear-overtaker shortcut for imminent collisions where
       `t_braked` is too small for the comparison below — **or**
       `closing_braked > closing_unbraked + brake_worsens_hysteresis_ms`
       — cross-traffic where braking parks ego in target's path), **or**
     - `braked_hit is None` and `v_target_along_ego > ego_speed` and the
       target is behind ego (`dx·ego_fwd < 0`): full braking clears a
       rear-overtaker entirely, but feeding its closing speed into
       required_decel still reads an adjacent-lane pass as a frontal
       threat (passing FP clips f0b2ace6 / 02642609). Scoped behind ego
       so a faster crosser ahead, where braking *is* the avoidance, still
       contributes.
   - Targets flagged `braking_worsens` are added to `braking_worsens_ids`
     and excluded from `best_ttb` / `best_v_closing`. AEB engagement on
     these is forbidden.
   - Non-worsens targets set `ttb = unbraked_ttc` and contribute to
     `best_ttb`, `best_closing_distance`, `best_v_closing` (all from the
     lowest-`ttb` target).
3. Required decel, **per target, aggregated by `max`** (`core/aeb/clearance.py`).
   The demand is the smallest constant ego decel that keeps ego's front behind
   every body it would otherwise occupy the same space as. See
   "Clearance-based demand" below for the derivation.
   ```
   # per occupancy sample k of one target, with lag = stop_buffer_response_s:
   D_k        = s_near(t_k) - ego_front_to_surface - stop_buffer   (- latched pad)
   a_roll     = 2 * (v0 * t_k - D_k) / (t_k - lag)²      # still rolling at t_k
   a_stop     = v0² / (2 * (D_k - v0 * lag))             # stopped before t_k
   a_k        = a_roll if a_roll * (t_k - lag) <= v0 else a_stop
   required_target   = max over k of a_k                 # INF when unavoidable
   required_decel    = max over targets of required_target
   road_grade        = tan(ego_pitch_rad), 0 if |·| > MAX_EGO_GRADE
   slope_accel       = g · sin(atan(road_grade))      # +ve = uphill
   downhill_offset   = max(−slope_accel, 0)           # gravity stealing brake force
   effective_max     = ego_decel_frac · capacity_estimate − downhill_offset
   capability_decel  = capacity_estimate − downhill_offset
   effective_required= required_decel + downhill_offset
   ```
   `max` over targets, not "the lowest-`ttb` target's demand". A crosser can now
   report a low demand honestly, and with the old single-target selection it
   would have masked a slower-`ttb` lead behind it. `best_ttb` stays a separate
   aggregate for the TTB slam and the displays.
   **The build-up reserve is latched at engagement.** Before engagement the lag
   term is live, because the entry decision has to
   account for build-up. Once engaged it becomes a fixed distance
   (`_engage_pad_dist_m`, seeded from the rate the binding constraint actually
   closes at) and `lag` goes to zero, cleared on disarm. Re-charging it every tick was
   the "brakes hard then fades out" complaint: the reserve shrinks with speed,
   so it hands metres back through the stop and the demand decays with it.
   Replayed on clip e9fb04c9 the commanded decel fell 10.68 to 0.41 m/s²
   across a 2.4 s event, with the warn still sounding at the end. Latched, the
   command holds, the event is 0.7-0.9 s shorter, and the residual gap grows
   from 3.1 m to 5.0 m at 100 km/h with the p90-lag margin unchanged.

   Note what this exposes rather than causes: with `aeb_engage_frac` at 0.85
   and `aeb_engage_frac_certain` at 0.90, AEB only fires when the threat needs
   ~90% of the truck, so a *consistent* stop at that demand is a near-maximum
   stop (~80% of the event at the command cap). The gentleness in the old
   profile was the reserve leaking, not a designed proportionality.

   Two bases, and mixing them up is the "AEB steps in far too early and then
   crawls to a stop" bug. `effective_max` caps the *command*, because
   `ego_decel_frac` is the headroom the tracking controller corrects into.
   `capability_decel` is what the truck can actually deliver, and that is the
   only honest question for an *entry* threshold. Basing entry on
   `effective_max` multiplied the two hedges and put the real bar at
   `0.85 · 0.90 = 0.765` of capacity: 3.7 m of extra trigger distance at
   100 km/h on a 13.89 m/s² double. Small next to the capacity error that
   shipped alongside it (20 m), but it compounds with it.
   `capacity_estimate` is read from `sending_thread.data.aeb_max_brake_ms2`
   (`tune_max * I / 1.1`, physical full-pedal decel) with a fallback to
   `max_brake_ms2` then a constant. The tracker itself stays in I=1.1 units
   for the mapper and ACC. Clip replay overrides `_read_max_brake_ms2` with
   the recorded number and must not re-apply the live slider.

   **The slope term is the one place radar's negated pitch does not cancel.**
   Every consumer in `core/radar/elevation.py` pairs `ego_pitch_rad` with a
   forward axis negated the same way, so the gate is exactly sign-invariant
   (radar README §15, "the doubly-negated frame"). Gravity has nothing to pair
   against, so this is the only site that has to know which way is up. Do not
   try to fix it by changing the sign in `core/radar/thread.py`: that breaks the
   gate and leaves this term wrong anyway.

   **A pose past `MAX_EGO_GRADE` reads level**, the same bound and the same
   discard-not-clamp policy the elevation gate uses. Unclamped, a wreck, an
   embankment or an airborne truck injected up to 9.81 m/s² into
   `effective_required` and out of `capability_decel`; measured `|ego grade|`
   p100 on real road is 0.126. Corpus effect of the clamp alone, over the 1,275
   clips scored both before and after: two false positives recovered
   (`bb8f3596`, `50df93bc`, both long weak brakings at 1.0-1.8 m/s² with no
   threat behind them) and **zero** other clips moved by any amount.

   `threat_present = required_decel > 0`. Slope modifies a threat-derived
   demand, it never sources one: `warn_by_decel` and the FF branch both
   require `threat_present`, so gravity alone can neither warn nor feed
   brake assist. Without that gate the offset raises `effective_required`
   and lowers `warn_threshold` (itself `0.5 · effective_max`) at the same
   time, so pitch alone crosses the bar once `downhill_offset ≥ 0.3 ·
   capacity_estimate`, about 17°. Public roads never reach that; a wreck,
   an embankment or an airborne truck does immediately, which was the
   phantom-warn-after-crash class (clip b530ea7b: 9 warn ticks and 92 FF
   ticks up to 3.16 m/s² with `colliding_ids` empty and `ttb`/`ttc` at
   infinity for the entire clip; 844 of 7199 corpus warn ticks were pure
   slope). `brake_ttb_active` is deliberately outside the gate: it owns the
   geometric threats where `required_decel` collapses to 0 by design.
4. Engagement hysteresis (slope-aware):
   - `brake_ttb_active = (time_to_brake < cal.brake_ttb + cal.brake_response_window_s)`
    : emergency criterion for path-crossing / arc-cross threats where
     `v_closing ≈ 0` collapses the `required_decel = v_closing²/2d` formula
     but the geometry still says full brake can't avoid intersection. The
     `brake_response_window_s` headroom compensates for actuator lag + the
     rate-limited brake ramp so the slam fires before impact rather than
     after the pedal has already needed to be at full. Without it, AEB
     stays in WARN forever in these scenarios.
   - Geometry-driven engagement latch: once engaged, hold engagement
     while any colliding target has `unbraked_ttc < disarm_hold_ttc_s`.
     A working brake pushes `effective_required` under the disarm
     threshold and headway over the distance latch by construction
     (`required ~ v²`, `headway = d/v`), so a narrow hold window releases
     mid-stop and the event pumps: release at ~30 km/h closing, coast,
     re-engage at 7 m (clip 29c8e7e0). The hold releases when the target
     clears laterally (not colliding), accelerates away (ttc grows), or
     ego stops (no closing → ttc ∞). Entry is untouched.
   - Latched threats never hold the brake by themselves: see
     "Latched-threat hold" below. The latched set keeps a target in the
     pipeline and on the instant re-engage path, nothing more.
   - Engage when `effective_required ≥ aeb_engage_frac · capability_decel`
     **OR** `brake_ttb_active`, subject to the tiered entry certainty gate
     below. `aeb_warn_near_full_frac` shares this base so it stays equal to
     `aeb_engage_frac` in absolute terms; `aeb_disarm_frac` and
     `aeb_warn_frac` stay on `effective_max` and are unchanged.
   - **Tiered entry certainty gate**: a new engagement additionally requires
     one of: (a) `brake_ttb_engage_active` (imminent, full brake barely
     avoids: instant), (b) certain geometry: a colliding, non-LOS-vetoed
     target in `Lane.EGO` with `|fwd_dot| ≥ aeb_certain_fwd_dot` (aligned
     in-lane traffic: rear-end or wrong-way, whose collision prediction
     barely depends on arc extrapolation: instant), (c) continuity: a
     colliding target already in `_latched_threat_ids` (instant), or (d)
     qualification sustained for a geometry-graded confirm window (tracked
     by `AEBThread._engage_confirm`, an `OccupancyConfirm`; reset while
     engaged): `aeb_engage_confirm_s` when any qualifying colliding
     target is **near-certain** (in `Lane.EGO`, or aligned `|fwd_dot| ≥
     aeb_certain_fwd_dot` in any lane: one classification step from
     certain), else `aeb_engage_confirm_oblique_s` for **oblique
     out-of-lane** threats, the extrapolation-fragile class (corner
     sweeps, mutual-turn passes) whose corpus phantoms qualify ≤ ~0.15 s.
     **Lapse tolerance (occupancy window).** The confirm window is not a
     hard-reset timer. `OccupancyConfirm` (`core/aeb/confirm.py`) tracks the
     per-frame qualification over a trailing window and fires when the
     window has elapsed AND the qualified fraction reaches
     `aeb_confirm_occupancy`, dropping the streak only after more than
     `aeb_confirm_max_gap_frames` consecutive unqualified frames. This
     absorbs the per-frame detection flicker (the 36-sample collision time
     grid, TMP jitter walking the predicted course across coverage edges)
     that used to restart the whole window on a single missed frame, without
     letting sparse 1-tick blips accumulate: they never reach the occupancy
     threshold and a long gap resets. The instant paths (a)/(b)/(c) and the
     reset-while-engaged behaviour are unchanged.
     Known trade at 0.20 s: a genuine perpendicular crosser whose
     qualification sustains ~0.16 s (clip ffd29f9e) loses the brake: warn
     still fires and the TTB slam net catches a materializing threat, but
     the phantom and genuine distributions touch at ~0.16 s, so the window
     cannot separate them perfectly. Rationale: corpus analysis showed phantom engagements
     from extrapolation-fragile crossing arcs qualify for 1-2 ticks and
     vanish, while genuine threats sustain qualification 3-30 ticks; and
     the dominant genuine classes (in-lane aligned) skip the wait entirely,
     so the confirm window costs real rear-end/head-on events zero latency.
     Required-decel magnitude is NOT a certainty signal: crossing-arc
     phantoms enter at ~200% of max (collapsed d_remaining) while genuine
     rear-ends enter at 70-100%. Warn and the FF-assist layer are untouched
     by this gate.
   - **Per-target risk confirm** shares the same `OccupancyConfirm`
     mechanism (`AEBThread._risk_confirm`, keyed by vehicle id). A colliding
     target must sustain qualification for `risk_confirm_s`
     (`risk_confirm_oncoming_s` for head-on) before it contributes to the
     aggregates; an id survives up to `aeb_confirm_max_gap_frames` missed
     frames before being dropped, so a single collision-grid dropout no
     longer restarts its clock or evicts it from the tracking dict.
   - Disarm when `effective_required <  aeb_disarm_frac · effective_max` **AND
     NOT** `brake_ttb_active` **AND NOT** `geom_threat_latched`.
5. Setpoint pipeline:
   - When `brake_ttb_active`: `target_raw = effective_max` (slam: required formula is unreliable).
   - Otherwise: `target_raw = clamp(effective_required, 0, effective_max)` while engaged.
   - **Deadband + rate-limit**: if `|Δ| < aeb_target_deadband_ms2` and the
     held value is younger than `aeb_target_refresh_min_s`, hold. Else move
     toward `target_raw` capped at `aeb_target_rate_ms3 · dt` (m/s² per tick).
   - The published value is `AEB_target_decel_ms2` consumed by sending_thread.
6. Flags:
   - `AEB_warn` rises on `effective_required ≥ aeb_warn_frac · effective_max`
     OR `time_to_brake < warn_ttb`, gated by warn persistence: certain /
     near-certain geometry, imminent TTB, latched threats, and active
     engagement warn instantly, while oblique out-of-lane threats must
     sustain the raw warn condition for the `aeb_warn_confirm_oblique_s`
     occupancy window (tracked by `AEBThread._warn_confirm`, an
     `OccupancyConfirm` observed every frame; the streak follows the raw
     condition, so the user-braking display suppression never resets it, and
     an isolated 1-2 frame dropout does not restart the window). Because warn
     qualifies on a superset of the engage-qualified frames, uses the same
     `aeb_confirm_occupancy` / `aeb_confirm_max_gap_frames`, and
     `aeb_warn_confirm_oblique_s ≤ aeb_engage_confirm_oblique_s − 0.1`, the
     warn streak confirms at least 0.1 s before an oblique engagement even
     through flicker: the driver's gas-override reaction window is preserved.
     Default `aeb_warn_confirm_oblique_s` is 0.30 s (paired with
     `aeb_warn_frac=0.60` and the vetoed window below): short clear-pass
     encounters that only flicker the raw condition may stay silent. That is
     intentional comfort trade; see TUNING.md TODO for residual false_warn.

     **Fully-vetoed out-of-lane persistence.** A second, longer occupancy
     window (`aeb_warn_confirm_vetoed_s`, `AEBThread._warn_vetoed_confirm`)
     applies on the frames where *every* colliding target is both in
     `engage_vetoed_ids` and outside ego's lane band
     (`ego_lane_colliding_ids`). That intersection is the extrapolation-phantom
     class: highway oncoming at tens of metres whose predicted contact the LOS
     or turn veto has already refused to engage on. The window is latency, not
     silence: a course that persists still warns, and the instant paths
     (engaged, TTB slam, latched) bypass it. A target only joins the vetoed set
     once its LOS track is long enough (`los_veto_min_samples`), so the opening
     frames of a short encounter still use the ordinary oblique timing.

     **Evidence-class persistence (oncoming / wide-lateral).** Two more
     all-targets windows sit alongside the vetoed one, because near-certain
     geometry alone was granting an instant warn to the corpus's two dominant
     phantom-beep classes. `aeb_warn_confirm_oncoming_s` applies while every
     colliding target is head-on or near-head-on: opposite-carriageway traffic
     is aligned (`|fwd_dot| >= aeb_certain_fwd_dot`), so it reached
     `nearcertain_geom_ids` and beeped on a single frame of corridor clip.
     `aeb_warn_confirm_wide_lat_s` applies while every colliding target
     projects more than `aeb_warn_wide_lat_m` off the ego arc, roughly a full
     lane over: slow or stopped vehicles ego is passing. Both are latency, not
     silence, and share the vetoed window's instant bypasses, with one
     exception: the TTB slam presumes an in-path target, so
     `aeb_warn_ttb_needs_narrow` makes an all-wide-lateral set clear the
     wide-lateral window even when `brake_ttb_active`. Separately,
     `aeb_warn_max_range_m` drops the raw warn when the nearest colliding
     target is past it: no corpus clip's genuine warn opens beyond ~80 m, and a
     beep about something further out is not actionable.

     **Class stickiness and the instant floor.** Two escapes closed the gate's
     back door. A target that shrinks under `aeb_warn_wide_lat_m` as it closes
     used to leave the wide class mid-approach and collect an instant warn the
     gate had been refusing a frame earlier, so the class is sticky across
     `aeb_warn_wide_lat_sticky_s` of lapse. The grace is deliberately short: it
     bridges a collision-grid dropout but lets a target that genuinely leaves
     and re-approaches start fresh, which is what keeps the one real trigger in
     `075d163a` while dropping its two phantom ones. Separately,
     `aeb_warn_instant_min_s` makes even certain geometry show a couple of
     frames of raw warn before the instant bypass fires, since a single-frame
     demand spike on a target that then vanishes is a tracking artefact that
     the 0.3 s state hold would otherwise stretch into an audible beep.

     Corpus effect of the whole gate: `false_warn` 43 -> 3, `TN` 286 -> 326,
     every other verdict unmoved. Three genuine clips lose their warn
     (`adf20ad7`, `4ba23e1c`, `505af174`, all one-to-two-frame blips). The
     dominant price is lead, not coverage: warn-before-brake clips 120 -> 59
     and clips with at least 0.3 s of lead 28 -> 14, almost all of it from
     `aeb_warn_instant_min_s`. Setting that knob to 0 restores lead (88
     warn-before-brake, 21 at >= 0.3 s) at the cost of one false_warn
     (`9fa4c844`). See TUNING.md before touching either.
   - `AEB_brake` is true while engagement is latched and the published target
     is above zero. Other subsystems (cruise/HMI) gate off this flag.
   - **User-braking suppression**: when `_read_user_braking()` is true and
     demand has not reached `aeb_warn_near_full_frac · capability_decel`,
     `AEB_warn` is forced false: a driver already braking is not warned about a
     threat they are handling. This silences the cue only. Engagement, the
     published target, and `AEB_brake` are untouched. Three sources count:
     - `main_pedal_thread.brakeval`, the physical brake axis, compared against
       `_USER_BRAKE_LATCH_THRESHOLD` (0.03).
     - `main_pedal_thread.opdbrakeval`, any OPD brake including the coast-down
       floor. Any value above zero silences the cue.
     - `sending_thread.mapper_command_brake`, the CC/ACC/limiter command. Any
       value above zero silences the cue.

     The physical-pedal threshold is a joystick deadzone: a light dab still
     counts, and AEB engagement remains the emergency override if it is not
     enough. OPD and the mapper have no floor: any commanded brake means
     MonoCruise is already slowing the truck.

     All three taps are AEB-free by construction: `brakeval` is raw axis input,
     `opdbrakeval` is snapped before the AEB override, and
     `mapper_command_brake` is read upstream of the point where AEB's FF and
     slam merge into the pedal. **Never source this from `abackward` or
     `brake_output`**: both contain AEB's own brake, so AEB would read its own
     output back and silence its own warning. The old `if self._engaged:
     return False` guard existed only to paper over that contamination.

     The TMP rel-speed latch and the shadow-near sampler still use
     `_read_addressing_brake` (physical / mapper above 0.03, no OPD): OPD
     coast-down is on whenever the foot is off the gas, and would pin that
     latch for the rest of the session.
7. Hold semantics: warn/brake state holds for 0.3 s after a downgrade to
   suppress chatter, identical to the old WARN→STANDBY hold. The hold shapes
   `aeb_state` and `AEB_brake`, but must **not** re-assert `AEB_warn` on a tick
   where the user-braking suppression fired. Suppression is computed before the
   hold and `warn_suppressed` carries past it. Without that carry the hold
   reinstated the cue for up to 0.3 s after every warn, and since each
   legitimate re-warn re-arms the hold, a driver braking through a decaying
   threat heard near-continuous beeping. Sound follows a two-tick gate on the
   HMI cue, and the cue is `AEB_warn OR AEB_brake`, not warn alone:
   `start_warning` only after two consecutive cue ticks, so a pulse the
   100 ms CC-panel poll never sampled cannot beep. Any cue end (threat gone,
   user-braking suppression, or brake released) uses soft `stop_warning()`:
   finish the current clip plus `_AEB_WARNING_STOP_EXTRA_REPLAYS`.
   `stop_warning(hard=True)` is teardown only.

   The brake half of the cue is load-bearing, and dropping it is how AEB
   brakes silently. `self._engaged` sits *inside* `if warn_raw:`, so an
   engagement latch can only upgrade an existing raw warn, it can never source
   one. A threat that spikes, engages, then leaves the corridor takes
   `effective_required` below `warn_threshold` on the very next tick while the
   latch keeps braking, so warn is a one-tick spike and the two-tick gate eats
   it. The 0.3 s hold does not rescue it either: the hold re-asserts warn only
   on a state *downgrade*, and the state stays BRAKE throughout. Clip
   `0a2dbd74` is the reference case: 42 brake ticks at 84 km/h, 2 warn ticks
   (the two engagement edges), no beep. 37 of 561 braking clips in the corpus
   never reached two consecutive warn ticks. Binding the cue to `AEB_brake`
   leaves `AEB_warn` itself untouched, so no corpus verdict moves, and it also
   means an engagement outbeats the user-braking suppression by construction,
   which is what "AEB engagement is the emergency override" above already
   promises.
8. Head-on targets: modelled as also braking at `full_brake_decel (7.8 m/s²)`
   inside the collision pipeline (unchanged).

### Clearance-based demand

`core/aeb/clearance.py`. Replaces `_required_decel_two_frame` and
`_codir_required_cap` for **every** target class; both functions survive only as
the `clearance_required_enabled = False` A/B path and as the fallback when a
target produces no corridor occupancy at all.

**The problem it fixes.** The relative frame drove `|v_ego − v_target|` to zero
over the closing distance. For a 90° crosser that vector is
`sqrt(v_ego² + v_t²)`, most of it lateral, and brakes cannot remove a lateral
component: ego at 80 km/h against a crosser at 90 reads ~120 km/h of "closing
speed" it must somehow shed. The `d_rel <= 0` fallback was worse in kind, not
just degree: it explicitly required ego to come to a full stop at the contact
point. Meanwhile the one model that credited target motion,
`_codir_required_cap`, returned `_INF` for anything with `fwd_dot < 0.7`. So a
crosser ego could simply arrive behind was priced as a wall, and AEB engaged
far earlier than the situation deserved.

**The model.** Braking cannot make ego arrive *earlier*, so the only escape
braking buys is *arrive behind*. Work in ego arc-length `s`: the arc's shape
comes from curvature, not speed, so it is fixed independently of the
deceleration being solved for. Sample the target capsule over the window, keep
the times it sits inside ego's corridor, and take `s_near(t)` as the smallest
arc-length any of its body points reaches. Ego's front must stay behind that
for every such `t`. Each sample yields a closed-form minimum decel (the two
branches in step 3 above, which meet continuously at `D = v0 · (t + lag) / 2`),
and the target's demand is their maximum.

**Why this is one model and not a crossing special case.** The same expression
reproduces what the old code computed by hand:

| Geometry | `s_near(t)` | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Steady lead in lane | `gap + v_lead · t`, linear | peaks at `t* = 2·gap/dv` and evaluates to exactly `dv² / (2 · d_rel)` |
| Braking lead | follows the lead's decel profile | lands on the `r_stop` branch, and reads **higher** where the binding moment falls between the lead's start and its stop |
| Head-on | shrinks; the arc already carries `full_brake_decel` | the honest requirement, and unavoidable geometries return `INF` as before |
| Crosser | ends when it vacates | demand is what it takes to be behind the conflict *while it is occupied*, which is the question that was never asked |
| Stopped / turning-in target | never ends inside the window | last sample binds: stop-short, unchanged |

**Perpendicular body buffer.** A crosser's heading and speed are not reliable,
so the physical capsule is not the whole threat. `_apply_cross_zone` expands
the target by `|sin(heading diff)|`: extra length of
`cross_zone_base + cross_zone_speed * v` along travel (1 m plus 0.3 s at
90 deg) and a radial halo of `cross_zone_radial` (0.7 m). Parallel and
head-on headings get zero. Collision and the occupancy profile both read the
inflated body, so a required stop also stops short of the halo. Lane
classification stays on the physical capsule. A turning body that only the
halo touches is a completing-turn graze (`TurningCrossTrafficFilter`); a
straight crosser the halo is the first to see stays a threat. Do not call
`ArcPath.build()` when applying the halo: `build()` re-derives `fwd` from yaw
and drops reverse travel. Do not restore the old ghost-arc comb.

`test_clearance.py` pins the first three as equivalences. The braking-lead case
is the one deliberate correction: `max(r_move, r_stop)` sampled two points of a
continuous curve and could under-read a hard-braking lead by about 30%.

**Horizon.** Collision detection keeps `dynamic_horizon` exactly, so
`colliding_ids`, `unbraked_ttc` and every filter verdict are untouched. The
solver samples its own copies of the target arcs (`dataclasses.replace` with a
longer `horizon`; only the `position_at_dist` clamp moves, the curve is the
same) over `clearance_samples` dense to `dynamic_horizon` plus
`clearance_far_samples` sparse to `clearance_horizon_s`. A target still in the
corridor at the window edge has its `s_near` linearly extrapolated to the
closed-form peak `t* = lag + 2·(C − dv·lag)/dv`, which is what recovers
`dv²/(2·(gap − dv·lag))` for a distant slow-closing lead instead of truncating
its demand to zero. That extrapolation is the same constant-velocity assumption
the relative frame always made, and it is bounded to 60 s past the window.

**Cost.** ~120 µs per colliding target worst case against a 33.3 ms tick, and it
only runs for targets that already produced a hit. Two implementation choices
carry that and are pinned by `test_the_solver_stays_cheap_enough_for_the_30_hz_loop`:
the lateral test runs *before* the arc-length one so `project_to_ego_arc` and
its `atan2` are only paid for points already inside the corridor (213 µs → 62 µs
for an identical result), and each arc is coarse-rejected on its body centre
before its five body points are touched.

**Fail-closed properties.** Every degenerate input resolves toward braking, not
away from it: a target that never clears gives stop-short; an already-overlapping
geometry gives `INF` (clamped to `_REQUIRED_CEIL_MS2` so logs and clip records
stay finite); no occupancy at all falls back to the old relative frame; and an
over-long predicted occupancy, which is what a bad target-speed estimate
produces, brakes *earlier*, not later. The TTB slam, `geom_threat_latched` and the
decel floor are all untouched.

**Corpus, 2026-08-24** (`clearance_required_enabled` off vs on). Two stores:
`score_once.py` only reads the local one, so the contributed store has to be
scored explicitly (`ClipStore(contributed_clip_root())`) or its clips are
silently absent from any A/B.

| | local off | local on | contrib off | contrib on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total cost (lower is better) | −41.93 | **−385.42** | 33.07 | **0.84** |
| True positives | 226 | 240 | 14 | 15 |
| False negatives | 46 | 30 | 2 | 1 |
| Late | 7 | 9 | 1 | 1 |
| False positives | 18 | 22 | 5 | 5 |
| False warns | 9 | 14 | 1 | 1 |

Scoring is deterministic: two identical runs agree on every clip. Numbers from
different sessions are not comparable, though, because the label set moves.

The gain is not the crossing work. It is the braking-lead correction and the
`max` aggregation, both of which raise the demand on genuine in-lane threats
that used to sit under the bar: 19 clips move the right way, and 10 of them
never see more than one colliding target at once, so the aggregation cannot
explain those. The crossing work shows up as *later* entry on events that
already engaged, which the corpus cannot price because its labels are windows,
not timings; `tests/aeb/test_crossing_clearance.py` measures that instead
(0.17 s to 0.50 s later on four crossing geometries, none dropped).

**The one new false positive is not a crosser.** `fa53208a` (sev 1) is ego
overtaking a slower vehicle about a lane and a half over: `fwd_dot` 1.00, 10 m
ahead, 4.6 to 5.6 m lateral, 18 km/h of closing. Its lateral gap is shrinking at
about 2.4 m/s, and the binding sample sits 1.4 s out where that extrapolates to
roughly a metre, so the model reads a cut-in and refuses to be alongside when it
lands. The demand is arithmetically right (`s_near` about 32.9 m against 36 m of
freewheel, with 1.0 s of braking left after the lag); whether the geometry is
real depends on whether that lateral convergence is the target merging or ego's
own arc bending under hard acceleration. Note the guard that would normally own
this class does not reach it: `codir_adjacent_veto_axial_ms` needs axial closing
under 2.0 m/s and this is 5.0.

The price is 4 false positives and 5 false warns, plus lost lead on two clips.

**The lost-lead class, and why the engage bar is not the lever.** `3a47b621`
(sev 5, TMP) keeps its true positive but its quality falls 0.81 to 0.19: an
oblique oncoming convergence, 45 m ahead and 28 m left at `fwd_dot` −0.47,
where the relative frame demanded 18.1 m/s² and the clearance model demands
6.7. Sweeping `aeb_engage_frac` from 0.90 down to **0.70 does not move it at
all** (brake at 8.64 s, quality 0.19, at every value), because the engagement
aggregate excludes engage-vetoed ids and the demand is not what is waiting. The
gate is `aeb_engage_confirm_oblique_s`: at 0.40 the brake lands at 8.64, at 0.30
8.55, at 0.20 8.47, at 0.0 8.28. Priced over the corpus, buying that lead back
costs false positives steeply and nothing else:

| `aeb_engage_confirm_oblique_s` | local cost | TP | FN | **FP** | `3a47b621` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0.40 (shipped)** | −385.42 | 240 | 30 | **22** | −1.90 |
| 0.30 | −378.46 | 240 | 30 | **26** | −3.04 |
| 0.25 | −377.81 | 240 | 30 | **28** | −3.60 |
| 0.20 | −390.60 | 241 | 29 | **33** | −4.04 |

Eleven extra unwanted brake interventions to buy one true positive and half of
one clip's lead. Total cost barely moves because the cost model prices FN at
10x FP, which is exactly where that model stops matching what a driver feels.
**Leave it at 0.40.**

`2202afb9` was the other one (sev 3, TP to FN) and is now labelled `ignore`, so
it no longer scores. The diagnosis is still worth keeping: a hard-braking lead
90 m ahead around a bend, relative frame 16.3 m/s², clearance model 5.8. By hand
(lead stopping from 14.2 m/s at about 10 m/s², ego at 23 m/s) it is roughly 4
plus the reserve, so **5.8 is the correct number and 16.3 was inflated
threefold** by the lateral part of `v_closing` on the bend. Do not "fix" either
clip by re-inflating the demand.

**Side effect worth knowing.** The demand layer now declines the measured
clear-pass oncoming case on geometry alone, reaching the same verdict the LOS
veto was added for (`test_the_clearance_model_alone_declines_the_measured_clear_pass`).
The vetoes still run and still scope to engagement entry.

### LOS-rate engagement veto (CBDR)

New engagements evaluate a second, engagement-only aggregate chain that
excludes targets vetoed by measured line-of-sight drift. A genuine collision
course holds near-constant world-frame bearing while range shrinks (constant
bearing, decreasing range); corner cross-traffic whose extrapolated arc
phantom-intersects ego's corridor drifts its bearing consistently instead.
Per target, `_los_predicted_miss()` fits bearing/range slopes over the last
`los_veto_window_s` of raw positions (`AEBThread._los_tracks`, fed every
frame for every tracked vehicle, pruned with the blender) and estimates
`d_miss = |omega_los| * R^2 / |v_rel|`. It is computed at most once per
vehicle per frame (`los_miss` memo in `loop`) and reused by every consumer
below.

Veto fires only when the track has `los_veto_min_samples`, the target is
beyond a range floor, and `d_miss` exceeds a miss bar. `_los_veto_bar()`
picks the pair:

| Geometry | Range floor | Miss bar | Why |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----|
| Co-directional or crossing | `los_veto_min_range_m` (25 m) | `los_veto_miss_dist_m` (6.0 m) | Relative motion is not constant, so the estimate needs a wide margin. Corpus separation: genuine engagement edges 0.05-4.4 m, corner phantoms 6.8-12.3 m. |
| Head-on (`fwd_dot < head_on_dot`) | `los_veto_headon_min_range_m` (20 m) | `los_veto_headon_miss_dist_m` (2.8 m) | An antiparallel encounter lasts 1-3 s and is decided by lateral separation alone, so the bar is physical body clearance (`ego_hw + target_hw` is about 2.4 m) plus measurement margin. |
| Head-on but manoeuvring | falls back to the general pair | | `|v_curvature| >= los_veto_headon_max_kappa` (0.05, about R 20 m) at `abs_speed >= los_veto_headon_min_speed_ms`: a target turning that hard is not holding a straight line, so straight-line CBDR does not describe it. The speed floor is required because `kappa = yaw_rate / v` diverges near zero speed. |

The head-on branch exists because the dominant labelled false-positive class
was oncoming traffic that the arc model placed in `Lane.EGO`. On a bend of
1000-1500 m radius the lateral shift over 40-90 m of straight-line
extrapolation is 1-4 m, which is exactly a lane width, and the steer-derived
ego curvature cannot see a bend that gentle. The 2.8 m bar was derived on the
360-clip corpus, where the split at the engaging tick was 8 genuine head-on
engagements measuring 0.19-2.72 m of miss against 13 phantoms measuring
1.74-6.24 m; it held unchanged when the corpus grew to 514.

Scope is strictly engagement *entry*: warn, disarm and the geometry latch
all keep the full aggregates, so a wrong veto costs latency on
one target, never silence. Vetoed ids are published in
`snapshot.los_vetoed_ids`.

### Extrapolation vetoes

`_extrapolation_veto()` bars engagement entry on two further classes where the
predicted contact rests on extrapolation the system cannot support. Both feed
the same engagement-only aggregate as the LOS veto, so warn and FF assist are
untouched. `ctx.lane == Lane.EGO` and `_any_body_in_ego_lane` are hard
exemptions: the trailer-in-lane rescue must survive both (clip 434f0401).
`extrap_veto_enabled` disables the whole helper.

- **Ego-turn extrapolation** (non-co-directional targets). A hit reachable only
  by holding the current steer for `turn_veto_min_ttc_s` (1.2 s) while
  `|ego_curvature| >= turn_veto_min_kappa` (0.012, about R 83 m) is vetoed.
  Real turns are transient (entry, apex, exit); a constant-curvature ego arc
  swept 20-30 degrees into a junction manufactures crossings with traffic on
  the road ego is turning onto. Near-term hits and straight-line driving are
  untouched, so the scope is junctions and roundabouts only. Corpus: the
  labelled phantoms sat at 17-31 degrees of required sweep with the target
  23-49 m off the ego arc, while every genuine engagement while turning had
  its hit within 0.5 s or its target inside the lane.
- **Matched-speed neighbour** (co-directional, out of lane). Vetoed when the
  axial closing speed `ego_speed - v_target_along_ego` is in
  `[0, codir_adjacent_veto_axial_ms)` (2.0 m/s) **and** the measured
  `d_miss >= codir_adjacent_veto_miss_m` (2.0 m). Braking removes at most the
  axial component, so at under 7 km/h of axial closure any predicted contact is
  lateral and brakes do not steer. Raising this to 4.0 silenced `bbed6ec4` but
  turned `5366cb63` TP into FN and `cf0b2767` TP into LATE; reverted. The lower bound of the band matters: a
  *faster* target is an overtaker, which `braking_worsens` already owns and
  which the corpus labels as a genuine threat when it cuts in. The miss term
  matters too: a neighbour whose measured track is converging on ego is a real
  side contact, and with no measurement yet the veto stays off.

### Closing-speed floor

`aeb_min_closing_ms` (1.0 m/s) bars engagement entry on any target whose
world-frame relative speed `|v_ego - v_target|` is under the bar, feeding
`closing_floor_ids` and the same engagement-only aggregate as the vetoes above.
It is a comfort gate, not a threat judgement: under 1 m/s the contact AEB would
prevent is a 3.6 km/h nudge, and an automatic stop is a worse outcome than the
bump it avoids. It applies to every class, not just the co-directional
neighbour `codir_adjacent_veto_axial_ms` already owns, because the same
argument holds for a crawling crosser and for a stopped obstacle ego is
creeping at.

Two consequences to keep in mind when reading a trace:

- **A decelerating lead is delayed, not suppressed.** Relative speed is
  measured at the current frame while `required_decel` already integrates the
  lead's deceleration, so a lead braking from matched speed sits under the bar
  for however long it takes to open 1 m/s of difference: about 0.2 s at 5 m/s²,
  and the gap it costs is that window times the closing rate, which is under
  0.1 m by construction. The threat is not re-derived from scratch: the frame
  the bar clears is the frame the existing demand engages on.
- **Warn and FF are untouched, holds are untouched.** Like the other
  engagement-entry gates, the floor is subtracted from `best_ttb_engage` and
  friends only. A target under the bar still warns, still feeds
  `AEB_ff_decel_ms2`, still counts for disarm and for the geometry latch,
  and an event already engaged runs to completion on the full
  aggregates. The one coupling is the documented `aeb_warn_confirm_vetoed_s`
  window, which a matched-speed target **out of ego's lane** now takes.

### Lane confidence range

`Lane.EGO` is treated as certainty only where pose can actually fix a lane.
For a non-co-directional target an unseen road bend displaces it by roughly
`kappa_road * s^2 / 2`, which reaches a lane half-width (1.95 m) at about 30 m
for the gentlest bend worth worrying about, so beyond
`lane_confidence_range_m` neither `certain_geom_ids` nor `nearcertain_geom_ids`
is populated and the target takes the oblique confirm window instead of an
instant engage. Engagement is not blocked, only its instant path: a stopped
obstacle 55 m ahead still brakes well outside the range, it just confirms
first (`test_far_obstacle_still_engages_through_the_confirm_window`).

**Co-directional targets are exempt** from both this range and the oblique
window, via `lane_trusted` and the `ctx.co_directional` term in
`nearcertain_geom_ids`. A pair travelling the same way shares whatever bend it
is on, so the bend's lateral error is common-mode and cancels; the pair is
simply not the extrapolation-fragile class the window exists for. Dropping
that exemption cost two true positives on the corpus (`cad4dae6`: a vehicle
merging in from the right and stopping dead ahead, 55 m to 15 m at constant
bearing, which read as "oblique" only because `fwd_dot` was 0.91 rather than
0.95).

A `lane_confidence_miss_m` clause used to re-earn the lane at any range when
the measured miss was near zero. It was **removed**: on the expanded corpus it
was wrong on every clip it touched (`44681ca9`, `4c18f4cd`, `d53658ef`,
`f0450e0f`, all labelled false positives). The reason is that `d_miss` scales
as `omega * R^2 / v_rel`, so at 40-120 m it is a short-baseline measurement
extrapolated over a long lever arm and cannot resolve the very bend that puts
the target in the wrong lane bucket. The measurement outranks pose only where
its own error is smaller than the pose error it is correcting, which for this
estimator means removing certainty (a *large* miss is robust to that noise),
not restoring it.

These mechanisms are a stopgap for not having a road model. When
`core/acc/road_model.py` is stable enough to consume here, the honest fix is to
project lane membership onto the estimated road instead of onto a
constant-curvature extrapolation, and these range and miss bars should be
re-derived against it rather than carried over.

### Geometry-graded engage fraction

`aeb_engage_frac` (0.85) is a hedge: only take the brake off the driver once
the situation needs most of the truck's capacity, because the geometry that
produced `required_decel` might be wrong. Where the geometry is certain that
hedge buys nothing, so the threshold is graded by the same
`certain_geom_ids` the confirm window already uses (aligned, in-lane,
lane-trusted, not engage-vetoed): `aeb_engage_frac_certain` (0.70) applies
when such a target is colliding, `aeb_engage_frac` otherwise.

This is the fix for the largest missed-positive class on the corpus: 21 of 79
misses were in-lane co-directional rear-ends the pipeline tracked as colliding
and warned on, whose demand peaked at 0.18-0.83 of capacity and so never
crossed a flat 0.85. On a 10 m/s² truck the graded bar engages at about
6.3 m/s² of required decel instead of 7.65, both of which are well past
comfortable braking (2-3 m/s²).

**This knob has no flat band.** Unlike the veto thresholds it is a pure
sensitivity trade, and every value buys true positives at a steady price in
false ones, so it should be re-priced against the corpus whenever the label
set changes rather than treated as settled:

| `aeb_engage_frac_certain` | TP | late | FN | FP | FP cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.85 (ungraded) | 161 | 5 | 74 | 6 | 0.83 |
| 0.80 | 167 | 4 | 69 | 6 | 0.86 |
| 0.75 | 169 | 4 | 67 | 7 | 1.42 |
| **0.70** | **174** | **6** | **60** | **8** | **3.26** |
| 0.65 | 177 | 5 | 58 | 10 | 8.38 |
| 0.60 | 182 | 9 | 49 | 10 | 10.71 |

0.80 is free. 0.70 is the knee. Below it the price climbs sharply: 0.65 costs
two more false positives and 2.5x the comfort cost for three true positives.
0.60 is available if the miss rate matters more than comfort: it costs the
same clip count as 0.65 but brakes harder on them. Every clip the lower bar
newly brakes on is the same shape as the ones it rescues (a co-directional
slow or stopped lead in ego's lane at 30-60 m), so there is no geometric
scoping that separates them: this really is the sensitivity dial.

Soft crawl / matched-speed in-lane rear-ends whose `v²/2d` stays under the
graded bar still only engage via the ~0.50 s TTB slam (or wait until demand
climbs). A former `certain_engage_ttb` bridge that engaged whenever TTB was
under 1.30 s for certain geometry was removed: at crawl speed that was metres
of bumper gap and felt like AEB ignoring the collision boxes.

### Oncoming clearance: pose plus measurement

`OppositeLaneFilter`'s body-separation fast path suppresses a head-on target
outright when its arc-projected offset already exceeds `ego_hw + v_hw_coll`.
That is the same extrapolation-fragile quantity the engagement vetoes exist to
distrust, and it accounted for 18 of the 79 missed positives: on every one of
them the fast path fired, and on several the measured CBDR miss flatly
contradicted the pose (clip 9cc70333: pose 9.1 m of clearance, measurement
0.44 m).

The fast path now also requires `ctx.d_miss >= clear_bar *
oncoming_body_sep_miss_scale`, failing open when there is no track yet. The
scale is **0.25**, not 1.0: at parity the guard costs 5 false positives for
2 true positives, because the pose-clear and measurement-clear populations
overlap heavily. At 0.25 it only overrides the shortcut when the measurement
says the two will pass within about 0.6 m of centreline separation, which is a
dead-on course, and it costs nothing. The remaining head-on misses need
evidence this system does not have; they are the road model's to fix.

### Latched-threat hold

`AEBThread._latched_threat_ids: set[int]` keeps an engaged target attached
to the pipeline across frames. It never holds the brake: after a threat, AEB
keeps braking only on demand (`effective_required` above the disarm bar), the
TTB slam, or `geom_threat_latched` (still colliding, unbraked TTC inside
`disarm_hold_ttc_s`). When the danger passes, AEB lets go. Membership does three
things:

1. **TMP rel-speed pre-filter bypass**: `TmpRelSpeedFilter` (and the
   matching precompute prefilter in `thread.py::loop`) skip the rel-speed
   gate for any id in the latched set. Without this, ego matching a TMP
   convoy partner's speed under braking drops `rel_kmh` below the 15 / 50
   km/h bar (section 4) and the target leaves the pipeline mid-stop.
2. **Spatial drop-filter bypass**: `OutOfLaneParallelFilter` and
   `EgoEvasionFilter` skip a latched id; `CornerEntryStationaryFilter` skips
   a latched **Mode B** (`Lane.EGO`) id. The 0.08 g evasion pair and Mode B
   `implied_kappa` are pose-jitter sensitive at short range and would otherwise
   fire on the vehicle AEB is already braking for. Six more stages keep a
   latched id whose **body is still in ego's lane ahead** (below).

**Body still in ego's lane ahead.** `OppositeLaneFilter`,
`CoDirectionalDivergeFilter`, `TurningCrossTrafficFilter`,
`TmpCrossTrafficFilter` and both corner-entry stages (Mode A) pass a latched id
when `_latched_body_in_lane` holds: a body centreline sample within
`lane_half_width` of ego's arc **and** ahead of ego's front (`s > 0`, the arc
starts at the front bumper), with ego at or above `aeb_min_engage_speed_kmh`.
These stages predict that a target will leave ego's path (it diverges, turns
off, sweeps past, or sits on a bend); before engagement that prediction is what
keeps AEB quiet, but once AEB is braking for a body that is still physically in
front of ego, the clearance demand already prices in the target's motion and
lets go when it really clears. Re-running the prediction mid-brake let go of the
vehicle instead (card 131, after the corner-entry case in `da5dee09`).

- **Ahead, not alongside.** Without `s > 0`, a TMP car passing on ego's hip at
  walking pace (`1a9f5ffa`, false positive) held the brake 2.3 s instead of
  0.6 s, through standstill and roll-back.
- **Engage floor.** Below `aeb_min_engage_speed_kmh` the driver has authority
  and no new event can start, so the filters keep their say there.
- **Body test, not every latched id.** Bypassing for any latched id gained less
  (corpus cost -1321 against -1331).
- **Entry unchanged.** Not-yet-latched targets still face every filter: the
  same body test at entry braked for parked trailers at the roadside (see the
  corner-entry section).
- **Measured** over 1321 scored clips: no verdict change, cost -1312.0 to
  -1330.9, 17 clips better (mostly TP quality, `77902df4` 0.20 to 0.98), two
  existing false positives brake longer (`3fe405cd` +0.27 s, `88726134`
  +0.07 s). Releases above 20 km/h with at least 3 m/s^2 of demand the tick
  before, where ego's body then came within 0.5 m of the target in the
  recording, fell 24 to 12 (`TmpCrossTrafficFilter`), 26 to 20
  (`OppositeLaneFilter`), 20 to 17 (`CoDirectionalDivergeFilter`) and 6 to 4
  (`TurningCrossTrafficFilter`). The rest are targets not yet in ego's lane
  when AEB lets go (cut-ins, oncoming drifting in, side crossers): an entry
  question, not a mid-brake one.
3. **Instant re-engage**: a latched id that becomes colliding again engages
   through the `certain` path, with no confirm window. The demand still has to
   clear the engage bar.

**Lifetime.** A hit (the id is in `colliding_ids`) refreshes the latch and
stamps `_latched_hit_mono`. Between hits, an id stays latched while it can
still steer into ego's lane: forward of ego along the arc (`s > 0`) and within
`cal.latched_steer_in_half_width_m` of it, which covers ego's lane and the
lanes either side. Out of that band longer than `cal.latched_scope_release_s`,
it is released; the grace absorbs lane-classification flicker. Inside it, it is
released `cal.latched_max_s` after its last hit, so no latch outlives its
threat by more than that. Stamps travel with the clip warm state
(`AEBWarmState.latched_scope_ok_mono`, `latched_hit_mono`); older clips start
both at the window start.

**Why there is no distance hold any more.** Until 2026-09-23 a latched id inside
`latched_min_headway_s` (1.5 s) of headway held engagement and floored the target
at 70 % of max. It dates from 2026-05-24, when the required decel was the relative
`v_closing^2 / 2d`: that collapses to 0 the moment ego matches a lead's speed, even
with the lead still braking two metres ahead. The clearance demand (section 5)
prices the lead's own braking in, and the geometry latch keeps a real collision
course engaged, so the hold only ever added braking after the danger had passed.
Clip `33d87007` is the case: a car cut in at 120 km/h, the threat ended at 5.31 s,
and the hold braked at 4 m/s^2 until 9.21 s while the car pulled away, until the
driver floored the gas. The 2026-09-11 opening-gap lookahead could not catch it: it
credited `closing x 1.0 s`, and a cut-in that has just been matched is not closing.
Two earlier fixes (scope release, the lookahead) narrowed the hold; neither changed
what it measured, a following distance, which is ACC's job and not an emergency.

Measured on removal: the corpus verdicts barely move (one FP becomes TN), 39
clips improve and 77 lose TP quality. The large losses are windows tagged
against the old pipeline: several end exactly where the hold used to release
(`77902df4`, `cbd525cd`), and others were copied from preview.20 recordings
whose live brake was the hold itself at `required 0.00` (`84faf786`,
`5f5bb8f3`). A closed-loop run on the real thread with a distracted driver
(lead braking hard, then on at 1.5 m/s^2 to a stop) shows the known cost: the
brake now tracks the demand smoothly instead of holding 4 m/s^2, and lets go at
walking pace once the lead is momentarily faster, so a driver who never brakes
rolls into the stopped lead below `aeb_min_engage_speed_kmh`. Accepted by design
(2026-09-23): AEB decides whether a danger exists, and with none predicted it
coasts. Do not add a stop-completion hold to cover this case.

| Knob | Default | Role |
|------|---------|------|
| `latched_scope_release_s` | 0.5 s | Grace before a latched id outside the steer-in band is dropped |
| `latched_steer_in_half_width_m` | 5.5 m | Half-width of the band a latched id may stay in between hits: ego's lane and the next one out |
| `latched_max_s` | 2.0 s | Longest a latched id outlives its last hit |

### Follow-threat flag

Behavioral latch for a genuine slowing lead (co-directional, sustained closing
and own deceleration over `follow_threat_window_s`, then `follow_threat_hold_s`).
While the hold is active, the target must be in `Lane.EGO` **or** arc-projected
`d_abs` must be shrinking at a cut-in rate (between
`follow_threat_min_lat_converge_ms` and `follow_threat_max_lat_converge_ms`).
A braking cut-in often decels before its centre enters ego lane. A parked body
ego sweeps past on a bend collapses `d_abs` at 15-25 m/s and must not inherit
the flag (`8e213c9e`).

   Flagged ids bypass `TmpRelSpeedFilter`, are exempt from
`CoDirectionalDivergeFilter`, are exempt from `EgoEvasionFilter` **only while
`ref_kmh_for_filter <= tmp_filter_split_kmh`** (the latched-id and in-lane
closer bypasses are separate and speed-agnostic), and get follow-track decel
on collision arcs so a braking lead does not clip through on constant-speed
projection. Implemented in `AEBThread._update_follow_threats`.

The speed gate on the evasion exemption is deliberate. The flag is a
lead-following signal of the same shape ACC uses, and following something is
not evidence that it is dangerous, so above the split it must not be able to
wave a target past a geometric filter. Below the split it stays unconditional
because `TmpRelSpeedFilter` is at its most aggressive there
(`rel > tmp_filter_rel_below_kmh` to survive) and would otherwise discard real
low-speed dangers.

| Knob | Default | Role |
|------|---------|------|
| `follow_threat_window_s` | 0.6 s | Trailing kinematic window |
| `follow_threat_hold_s` | 2.0 s | Hold after kinematic qualification |
| `follow_threat_min_decel_ms2` | 0.8 m/s² | Min own-decel slope to qualify |
| `follow_threat_max_lat_converge_ms` | 10.0 m/s | Cap on the out-of-lane lat-converge seat; sweep-past is faster |

### Closed-loop coupling

`sending_thread` consumes `AEB_target_decel_ms2` via `AEBDecelController`:
- Feedforward pedal from the inverse brake curve (`_brake_pedal_from_decel`).
- Disturbance observer instead of a PI: a brake-plant model (dead time plus
  first-order lag, keyed on trailer presence) is driven by the pedal actually
  sent to the game, and the filtered residual against measured decel is the
  environment bias. That bias is subtracted from the target before the inverse
  curve, so grade, capacity error and curve error are compensated without an
  integrator to wind up. Both model taus are set slower than the measured
  median on purpose: modelling the plant slower than it is biases the estimate
  toward under-braking, and only over-braking is dangerous.
- Decel measurement for this loop uses its own 0.12 s differentiator, not the
  0.30 s `_spd_smooth` that capacity learning and published telemetry read.
- The merge stays `b = max(b, aeb_pedal)`, so a driver out-braking AEB wins,
  and `AEB_ff_decel_ms2` floors the commanded decel so a stale target cannot
  silence AEB.
- `AEB_required_decel_ms2` is published **uncapped** for this reason: when it
  reaches the decel pedal 1.0 can deliver, sending_thread slams rather than
  inverting the curve at the `ego_decel_frac`-capped target. Do not clamp that
  field to `effective_max_decel`, it is the saturation signal.
- Mapper's fast-PID trim is frozen while `AEB_brake` is true (via
  `AccelToPedals.step(..., freeze_trim=True)`) so two controllers don't
  fight on the brake.
- All three AEB→pedal paths (engagement slam in `main_pedal_thread`, FF
  additive in `sending_thread`, closed-loop controller in `sending_thread`)
  are gated by `gas_output / gasval >= 0.8`: full gas pedal is the user
  override and defeats AEB braking authority across every layer.

## 6. Elevation filter (shared road-surface gate)

AEB no longer owns an elevation test. `RadarThread` runs the shared gate
(`core/radar/elevation.py`) once per frame and publishes
`RadarData.off_surface_ids`; the AEB snapshot carries that set and three
places consume it: the collision-arc precompute, the fallback path, and
`ElevationFilter` in the pipeline.

```python
off_surface_ids = off_surface_ids - self._latched_threat_ids   # never drop a latched threat
...
if v.id in off_surface_ids:
    continue
```

The full model, the constants, the corpus fits behind them and the failsafe
list live in `core/radar/README.md` §15. Two properties matter here:

- The band is **tighter than the old ±5 m window inside ~65 m** (it kills
  traffic on a road under a bridge ego is crossing) and **wider beyond it**
  (a lead over a crest is no longer lost). Measured: the old window dropped
  4.06 % of candidate leads above 85 km/h; the new gate drops 0.00 %.
- Suppression is **latched-threat-exempt and persistence-gated**, so no
  single-frame rotation or pitch glitch can pull a target out of the
  pipeline mid-event.

`cal.elevation_margin` is retained on `AEBCalibration` for recorded-clip
metadata compatibility only. It no longer gates anything: do not tune it.

---

## 7. Calibration constants

The full constant-by-constant reference moved to `core/aeb/TUNING.md`. All tunables
live in `AEBCalibration` (frozen dataclass, `core/aeb/calibration.py`); `DEFAULT` is
the production singleton and tests pass a modified instance to `build_pipeline(cal)`
or `evaluate_frame(frame, cal)`.

## 8. Head-on lateral-gap activation

`cal.lane_separation = 3.9 m`: oncoming vehicles whose centerlines are this far
apart laterally are suppressed at the `arc_arc_collision` level
(`min_lateral_gap`). Passed only for `near_head_on` vehicles (`fwd_dot < -0.5`),
which excludes reversing targets: the gap assumes a driver keeping to its own lane.

---

## 9. Critical Rules: Do Not Break (AEB-specific)

Agent-facing copy of these rules also lives in the top-level `AGENTS.md` (keep that in sync if you change them).

- **AEB is a consumer of `RadarThread`.** Do not open the traffic shared-memory buffer directly and do not mutate `Vehicle` instances.
- **Elevation comes from radar's `off_surface_ids`, minus the latched set.** Do not reintroduce a local pitch-window test in `thread.py` or `filters.py`, and do not tune `cal.elevation_margin`: it is dead, kept only so recorded clip calibrations still deserialize. See `core/radar/README.md` §15.
- **AEB ego curvature is the yaw-rate proxy, full stop.** Do not read `RadarData.ego_curvature` from AEB.
- **Target-vehicle curvature is the `_vehicle_curvature_blend` helper** (sliced position fit blended with `angular_velocity`-derived yaw rate, weighted by `cal.aeb_yaw_blend`, then One-Euro filtered per-vehicle by `AEBThread._curvature_blender`). Do not call `v.curvature_from_history()` directly from AEB paths and do not enlarge `aeb_pos_history_len` toward 25. The blender must be stepped exactly **once per vehicle per frame**: any new call site must thread the existing `ctx.v_curvature` through rather than re-invoking `_vehicle_curvature_blend(...)` with the production blender.
- **`co_directional` must use `fwd_dot > 0.7`, not `abs(fwd_dot) > 0.7`.** The two flags must be mutually exclusive with `head_on`.
- **Regimes read the travel direction, and a reversing target is never oncoming.** Take `fwd_dot` through `travel_sign(v.speed, cal)` wherever it decides a regime, and keep `head_on` / `near_head_on` false for a reversing target. Heading alone dropped a truck backing across ego's lane (d80936f9); travel alone put a rig backing into the lane under the oncoming evasion rules (66874532). See the travel frame section.
- **All tunable constants live in `AEBCalibration`.** Do not introduce new bare numeric literals in `thread.py` or `filters.py`. Add the constant to `calibration.py` first.
- **`lane_frame.project_to_ego_arc` is the canonical lane primitive.** Do not use cross-product `lateral_offset` for lane classification: it compresses on curved roads. The `max(d_arc, d_straight)` formula in `project_to_ego_arc` is the safety-critical fix.
- **`OppositeLaneFilter` body-separation check uses `ego_hw + v_hw_coll`, not corridor width.** The margin (`corridor_margin=0.5 m`) is for probabilistic corridor overlap; body separation uses only actual half-widths.
- **`EgoEvasionFilter` uses `margin=0.0` for evasion arc checks.** Physical body clearance, not padded corridors. Main collision detection still uses `cal.corridor_margin`.
- **Fix B has no ego_k guard.** The `own_lane` check is the only gate; `|ego_curvature|` expands `delta_kappa_t` only if it would actually increase it.
- **Fix D (target arc over-rotation damping) applies to `arc_curvature`, not `v_curvature`.** `v_curvature` is the raw measured value used by `same_curve` and `CoDirectionalDivergeFilter`. Collision and visualization arcs both use the damped `arc_curvature` when building predicted paths.
- **`LaneClassifier` must run before `OppositeLaneFilter`, `CoDirectionalDivergeFilter`, and `EgoEvasionFilter`**: those stages read `ctx.lane`, `ctx.fwd_dot`, `ctx.v_curvature` etc. populated by `LaneClassifier`.
- **TMP trailer-as-vehicles get tractor speed/accel via `_swap_trailer_kinematics`.** Buffer speed for trailer slots is unreliable (often 0). The swap is done on a shallow copy: never mutate the original Vehicle.
- **AEB pedal authority is two-layered, never binary-gated to zero.** AEB publishes `AEB_ff_decel_ms2` every tick when there is any real threat (`required_decel > 0`); sending_thread converts it to a brake pedal via the inverse FF curve and merges it as `b = max(b, aeb_ff_pedal)`. This is the **sub-engagement assist** layer: it adds force on top of user braking when the system warns but has not yet engaged. It is **ramped**, not gated: the assist weight rises linearly from 0 at `cal.ff_assist_ramp_lo` (0.03) to 1 at `cal.user_brake_latch` (0.12), and the merge is `b = max(b, b + (aeb_ff_pedal - b) * w)`. Below the ramp floor it contributes nothing, so it still cannot phantom-brake during normal manual cruising where routine lead-following yields a small non-zero `required_decel` (measured median FF pedal there: 0.004). At or above `user_brake_latch` the weight is 1 and the expression collapses to the original `max(b, aeb_ff_pedal)`, so behaviour above the old gate is unchanged. The ramp exists because a hard gate at 0.12 activated the assist only where the driver was already out-braking it (median jump **−0.187** pedal, i.e. inert) while blocking it across 0.03–0.12 where it would actually add force (median **+0.054**, 51% of those ticks carrying `ff_decel ≥ 2.0`). Dropping the gate outright instead was rejected: it left an 0.877-pedal worst-case jump off a 6% dab, which the ramp cuts to 0.476 and takes to zero above 0.60. When AEB engages (`AEB_brake == True`), main_pedal_thread cuts gas only; the brake is owned by `AEBDecelController` in sending_thread, which tracks `AEB_target_decel_ms2` (the **closed-loop** layer). All AEB pedal paths are gated by `gas_output >= 0.8` (full-gas user authority, the only override that can defeat AEB braking).

**History (2026-08-11):** main_pedal_thread used to slam `brake_output = 1.0` on engagement. Because sending_thread merges every AEB path with `max()`, that slam pinned the pedal at 1.0 for the whole engagement and `AEBDecelController` never influenced the output: `AEB_target_decel_ms2` and its rate limit were dead code. Measured over 32 engagement clips, realized decel was a median **2.25x** the published target, which left **5 to 6 m** of unused gap on 65 km/h stops (0.2 m at crawl, hence the speed-squared symptom). An earlier attempt to drop the slam in favour of *pure FF* was reverted because AEB felt silenced; that failed for two reasons now fixed: the target ramped from 0 at `aeb_target_rate_ms3` (0.8 s to reach the requirement, so the first bite was ~0.005 pedal), and there was no pad for brake build-up. Engagement now steps the target straight to the requirement, and `stop_buffer_response_s` covers the plant lag. Do not restore the slam without re-reading the high-speed stop overshoot notes: a `max()`-merged constant of 1.0 silently disables every layer beneath it.
- **AEB and em_stop send on the full brake axis.** The `g_brake_intensity` invert is for mapper/ACC. While `AEB_brake` or `em_stop` is true, `apply_brake_intensity(..., full_authority=True)` writes the logical pedal. AEB planning and `AEBDecelController` use `aeb_max_brake_ms2 = tune_max * I / 1.1` so the estimated max decel is the physical force pedal 1.0 can make. Sub-engagement FF assist stays on the invert and the unscaled tracker. `I < 1.0` cannot be fully recovered; warn hourly while AEB is enabled, never when it is off. Do not remap an engaged AEB back onto the 1.1 invert, and do not leave AEB planning on the unscaled tracker: that made a 150% slider look like the 1.1 tune.
- **Engagement-entry vetoes never touch warn timing beyond persistence, and never touch FF assist, disarm, or the holds.** `_los_veto_bar`, `_extrapolation_veto`, the closing-speed floor, and the lane-confidence range all feed `engage_vetoed_ids`, which is subtracted from the engagement-only aggregate chain (`best_ttb_engage` and friends) and from the `certain_geom` instant path. The full aggregates still drive `AEB_warn`, `AEB_ff_decel_ms2`, the disarm gate and the geometry latch. The one permitted coupling is `aeb_warn_confirm_vetoed_s`: when every colliding target is vetoed **and** out of ego's lane, warn waits on a longer occupancy window. That is a delay a persisting course clears, not a suppression, and a vetoed target may never be removed from the warn aggregate outright. Keep it that way: a wrong veto must cost latency on one target, never silence. Measured on the labelled corpus, the vetoes left warn coverage on positive clips unchanged (135 of 160 clips, identical lead-time distribution) while cutting warn ticks on must-not-trigger clips by 11 %.
- **A measured miss may remove certainty, never grant it.** The vetoes exist because arc-projected lane membership is an extrapolation and the CBDR miss is a measurement, so a *large* measured miss removes certainty (head-on bar, matched-speed neighbour). The converse does not hold: `d_miss` scales as `omega * R^2 / v_rel`, so a small value at range is not evidence of danger, it is a short-baseline fit over a long lever arm. A `lane_confidence_miss_m` clause that restored certainty on a small miss was tried and removed after the corpus grew: it was wrong on all four clips it affected. Also do not let a veto fire with no measurement at all unless its own physics stands alone (the ego-turn branch does; the matched-speed branch deliberately does not).
- **The engage fraction is graded by certainty, and only by certainty.** `aeb_engage_frac_certain` applies when a colliding, non-engage-vetoed target is in `certain_geom_ids`, the same set that grants the instant confirm path. Do not widen it to `nearcertain_geom_ids` or to demand magnitude: required-decel size is not a certainty signal (see the tiered entry gate), and the corpus shows every clip the lower bar newly brakes on is geometrically identical to the ones it rescues. Unlike the veto thresholds it has no flat band, so re-price it against the corpus rather than assuming it still holds.
- **Co-directional targets are exempt from the lane-confidence range and the oblique confirm window.** Both exemptions rest on the same fact: a pair travelling the same way shares whatever bend it is on, so the bend's lateral error is common-mode. Removing either one costs true positives on vehicles merging in and stopping ahead, which read as oblique purely because `fwd_dot` lands just under `aeb_certain_fwd_dot`.
- **Warn suppression while already braking.** `aeb_warn` is suppressed when `_read_user_braking()` is true UNLESS `effective_required >= cal.aeb_warn_near_full_frac × capability_decel`. That helper is true for the driver's physical `brakeval` above `_USER_BRAKE_LATCH_THRESHOLD` (0.03), or any `opdbrakeval` / `sending_thread.mapper_command_brake` above zero. All three taps are AEB-free by construction; never source it from `abackward` or `brake_output`, which carry AEB's own slam and FF and would silence the warn during engagement. The driver / ACC / OPD already addressing the threat does not need a redundant alert: only surface it when AEB itself wants near-full brake.

`tests/aeb/test_engage_vetoes.py` covers the engagement-entry vetoes. The
scenario harness (`evaluate_frame`) stops at the filter pipeline and does not
run the engagement state machine, so those tests drive whole synthetic clips
through `run_headless` instead: ego and an oncoming vehicle on a shared 1200 m
bend with ego reporting zero steer, which is the mechanism the head-on bar
exists for. Only the oncoming lane offset changes between cases (0 m and 2 m
brake, 3 m does not and only warns).

Run with: `pytest tests/aeb -v`

### Stop-distance envelope: the arbiter for entry-bar changes

`tests/aeb/test_stop_distance_envelope.py` simulates a whole AEB stop: the
shipped `_required_decel_two_frame`, the shipped entry bar, the real
`AEBDecelController`, and a brake plant fitted to 61 recorded braking episodes
(dead time 0.12 s, tau 0.19 s median / 0.31 s p90). It reports residual gap.

**Use it, not the corpus, whenever the engage point moves.** Corpus labels were
tagged against one engage point, so shifting the bar re-labels clips instead of
scoring them, and the shift always reads as a swing in FN. Worse, headless
replay scores the engagement decision and never touches the brake pedal, so it
is structurally blind to whether the truck actually stops. The corpus arbitrates
*filtering*; this arbitrates *timing*.

What it pins:

- with the capacity estimate correct, every rig stops clear at 40-120 km/h;
- at `_BRAKE_SCALE_MAX` (1.05× truth) it still stops — collisions begin near
  1.10×, which is where that ceiling comes from;
- under-reading capacity is always safe, just early and soft;
- the response pads survive p90 brake build-up;
- **a descent engages earlier, not later.** The two bases diverge on a grade
  (`capability_decel` loses the gravity term, `effective_required` gains it), so
  the bar in raw required-decel terms is `frac · (capacity − downhill) −
  downhill` and falls about twice as fast as capability does. On an 8% descent a
  bobtail engages on 7.2 m/s² instead of 8.7 and finishes with 2.4 m more in
  hand. This was expected to be the dangerous case and is the opposite;
- **the decel controller is not bypassed.** Entry at 0.85 of capability leaves
  only 5.6% below the command cap, which looked thin enough that the saturation
  override might hold pedal 1.0 for whole events and reinstate the old slam.
  Measured duty at full pedal is 0.17-0.36 of engaged ticks on the flat and
  lower on a grade, so most of a stop is genuine tracking.

The closed loop converges onto the distance it planned for, finishing on
`stop_buffer`, so there is no slack beyond what the pad and the capacity
estimate provide. That is why both are treated as safety parameters.

### Corpus result

Measured over the 514 labelled clips in the local store (272 must-not-trigger,
242 with a should-trigger window). "vetoes" is the engagement-entry work;
"graded" adds the geometry-graded engage fraction and the oncoming clearance
guard:

| | before | vetoes | + graded |
|---|---|---|---|
| False positives (must-not-trigger clips that engaged) | 46 | 6 | 8 |
| ... in SP | 14 | 4 | 4 |
| ... in TMP | 32 | 2 | 4 |
| Comfort cost of those engagements | 21.18 | 0.83 | 3.26 |
| True positives | 161 | 161 | 174 |
| Late | 5 | 5 | 7 |
| False negatives | 74 | 74 | 59 |
| Total corpus cost | 1038.3 | 1033.2 | 654.5 |

No clip regresses on the positive side against the original at any stage.

The positive side is bit-identical, and setting the new knobs back to their
pre-change values reproduces the old score exactly, so nothing else moved.

Every **veto** threshold sits inside a flat response band rather than on a
cliff, which is the check that those numbers are not fitted to individual
clips: `lane_confidence_range_m` is flat over 25-33 m,
`los_veto_headon_miss_dist_m` over 2.4-2.8 m, `turn_veto_min_kappa` over
0.008-0.018, `turn_veto_min_ttc_s` over 0.8-1.2 s, and
`codir_adjacent_veto_axial_ms` over 1.5-2.0 m/s. `turn_veto_min_kappa` 0.008
removes one more sev-1 false positive but sits one step from 0.006, which
costs a true positive; 0.012 keeps the margin instead.
`aeb_engage_frac_certain` is the exception and has no such band: see the
geometry-graded engage section for its trade curve.

The eight survivors are two stopped-vehicle-at-the-lane-edge clips
(`15eba13d`, `7add71c9`, both sev 1, sitting inside the distribution of
genuine stopped-lead engagements), two long-range oncoming clips (`1c25f5a1`
at 60 m, `27ba3683` at 94 m), two far off-lane clips (`4099ba36`, `6a9c94cd`)
whose ego curvature falls just under the turn veto, and the two slow-lead
clips the graded engage bar buys (`6d23fe39`, `82acb8e8`). Together they cost
3.26, against 21.18 before.

### Steer formula for scenarios

The AEB yaw-rate proxy: `kappa = radians(steer * speed * 12) / speed = radians(steer * 12)`.
Inverting: `steer = kappa * 180 / (12 * pi)` (speed cancels).
Do **not** include `speed` in the inverse formula.

---

## 11. Review and labelling tool

`python -m tools.aeb_review` (dev only, never shipped). `tools/aeb_review.py` holds
the window and the label form; `tools/aeb_review_widgets.py` holds the scene, the
timeline strip, the key table and the background decoder; `tools/aeb_filter_trace.py`
and `tools/aeb_filter_charts.py` hold the `C` filter-tuning window.

### Ground reference markers

The scene is ego-locked: ego sits at a fixed screen point and the range rings are
drawn around it, so nothing in the background moves when ego drives. A replay of a
straight 90 km/h run and a replay of a truck parked at a light look the same, and a
heading change only shows up as the whole world silently swinging.

`_draw_ground_markers` fixes that with a world-anchored dot lattice: a small dot at
every 10 m of the world X/Z grid, a larger one where both axes hit a 100 m multiple.
Because the dots are pinned to world coordinates, they slide backwards at ego's
speed and rotate with ego's heading, which is what makes acceleration, braking and
steering readable frame to frame. They double as a scale: dot to dot is 10 m.

The lattice is culled to the window rect, so a 1200x700 view draws about 280 dots
and costs ~1.2 ms of a 33 ms frame. `_MARKER_MAX_DOTS` bounds the candidate loop;
past it the 10 m dots are dropped and only the 100 m ones remain, so an absurdly
large window degrades instead of stalling the repaint.

### Decode happens off the GUI thread

Opening a clip is the gzip (`ClipStore.load`, about 20 ms) and then the radar
replay. A tagging load measures about 0.4 s. The chart trace is another 0.1 s
and runs only while that window is open. The AEB re-run (about 0.8 s) stays a
separate job.

Decode has its own thread. Scan, the server pull, and the chart jobs share
another, so a rescan cannot sit in front of the clip you just clicked. The
window keeps eight decoded clips and queues the next four. The thumbnail and
the label form are filled from the gzip before the replay finishes.

`replay_frames` used to run twice per open, because the ego-path gain rebuilt
the clock on its own. It runs once now, and that pass reads slot kinematics
instead of building `Vehicle` objects: about 15 ms, down from about 120 ms.
What is left is `TrafficReader.replay_frame`, the same smoother live radar
runs, plus the arc snapshots the scene draws. Do not skip the smoother to make
the open faster. The scene would no longer be what AEB saw.

The review scene does not read `off_by_t`, so its decode skips the elevation
gate. The chart re-run decodes again with the gate on, because headless AEB
reads those ids. Do not feed the review stream into `run_headless`.

### The clip list

A rescan used to gunzip every clip's metadata on the decode thread. On 2275
clips that was about 4 s with the files already cached and about 12 s from a
cold disk, and the first open waited behind it.

Each store keeps `.review_index.json` next to the clips: filename, mtime in
nanoseconds (stored as text, the integer does not round-trip through JSON),
size, clip id, trigger, label, notes. A refresh stats the directory and peeks
only new or rewritten files. Reopening the tool is about 0.07 s for both
stores. The first open, or a refresh with no index, peeks on eight threads:
about 2 s for 2275 clips. `list_clips` only matches `*.json.gz`, so the index
is not a clip and is not uploaded.

`ClipStore.peek_metadata` reads a 64 KB prefix before falling back to the whole
file. Metadata needs a median 14 KB of a 423 KB clip (max seen 20 KB), so a
listing touches a few percent of the store instead of all of it. The fallback
matters: `thumbnail_jpeg` lives in the metadata and can push it past the prefix.

### Traffic does not start the clip at 0 km/h

A clip window is an arbitrary cut of a continuous stream, so every vehicle in the
first frame was already moving and live radar already had a warm filter for it.
Replay used to start each one cold, which showed up as the jump at the head of
every clip: 0 km/h, then a ramp. Measured over 40 clips against a centred offline
fit, mean speed error was **40.0 km/h at t=0** (p90 92.9) and stayed above the
steady-state floor for about a second.

`cold_start_speeds(clip)` reads ahead over the leading frames, takes each id's
first four buffer positions at the live full-update cadence, and fits them with
`_raw_speed_from_position_history`, the same estimator the live chain uses. Both
the traffic and the parked buffer are scanned, in the id-precedence order
`replay_frame` uses: the parked buffer carries moving vehicles too, and they are
built with `speed = 0.0`. The result goes to `TrafficReader.set_cold_start_speeds`
(see core/radar/README.md section 7). Error at t=0 drops to **2.5 km/h**, which is
the same as the steady-state error at t=1.2 s: no transient left.

**The corpus objective was being paid for this.** Seven clips had a brake window
opening within 0.12 s of the `burn_in_s` edge, latched since the clip's start by
traffic that read as stopped; five of them scored TP quality 1.00 by braking six
seconds before the labelled event, and one scored an outright false positive. With
the seed, five move to the real event, the false positive disappears, and no clip
gains a brake. On the 792 clips both runs score, the total moves -441.00 to
-431.57: the metric giving back credit it should not have had, not a behaviour
regression. (The published -421.00 baseline was over 793 clips; the extra one has
since been relabelled `ignore`, which is unrelated to this change.) The
synthetic phasings in `tests/aeb/test_crossing_clearance.py` and
`tests/aeb/test_engage_vetoes.py` were measured against the cold start and were
re-measured with it gone.

### Desmoothing the recorded decel

`LiveAEB.target_decel_ms2` is what the tick **published**, after the deadband
(`aeb_target_deadband_ms2`, `aeb_target_refresh_min_s`) and the slew limit
(`aeb_target_rate_ms3`). On a real engagement it reads 0.26, 1.11, 1.40, 1.67 over
four ticks while the demand was already at full capacity (10.84 m/s²). Plotting the
published value puts the apparent moment of threat up to half a second late, which
is exactly the moment the reviewer is placing a window against.

`clip_replay.raw_target_decel` rebuilds the pre-slew `target_raw` from the recorded
tick (`engaged`, `time_to_brake` against `brake_ttb + brake_response_window_s`,
`required_decel_ms2` clamped to `effective_max_decel_ms2`) and `replay_clip` puts it
on every `ReviewFrame` as `raw_target_ms2`. It was inexact only under the latched-hold
floor, which no longer exists, so clips recorded on preview.23 or older can read below
the recorded target during a hold tail. It is never wrong about onset timing, which is
what it is drawn for. `required_decel_ms2` is already raw and needs no rebuild.

### Filter tuning charts (C)

The scene answers "what did AEB decide". It cannot answer "why did this vehicle's
speed read 42 m/s while it was doing 36", which is a radar-filter question and the
one that a suspicious clip usually turns into. `C` opens a separate top-level window
plotting one vehicle's chain over the clip: the speed chain (raw through
`speed_ema`, `speed_corr` and `acc_speed`), the accel chain against its gate
thresholds, the step 4 gates including `tau`, the four lag entry gates, and a row
per filter state flag. `tools/README.md` documents the lanes and the axes.

Nothing is simulated. While the chart window is open, `ClipLoader.load` derives
the trace from the same `decode_radar_stream` result as the review frames, about
0.1 s. A tagging pass does not build it. Opening the window later reuses the
stream kept on the decoded clip, so it does not replay the radar again. Values
are read off the replayed `Vehicle` objects, or rebuilt with the production helpers.

Two decision bands sit above the lanes: `rec` from the clip, and `now` from
`clip_eval.run_headless` at the working tree's constants, with the disagreements
ticked. The re-run is 0.8 s a clip, more than the rest of the load put together,
so it is a lazy follow-up job that only fires while the chart window is open. Do
not move it into `ClipLoader.load`: that cost lands on every clip in a tagging
pass, which is the one thing the review tool is optimised against.

The step 4 gates are the exception: `_acc_speed_step` returns only a speed, so the
tool restates that arithmetic to expose `tau`, `ramp`, `consistency` and `ff_gate`.
Every frame carries the residual between the rebuilt `acc_speed` and the recorded
one, and `tests/aeb/test_filter_charts.py` fails if they ever disagree. Do not
relax that test: without it the gate lane can drift away from `traffic.py` and keep
drawing confident, wrong curves.

The two windows share one clock and one keymap. Scrubbing either moves both, the
vehicle picker follows the labelled target until it is used by hand, and every
review binding still works while the chart window has focus, so a tagging pass
never has to click back.

### Should-trigger window proposal

`recorded_band` proposes the span the live AEB reacted over: the warn-or-brake
ticks, or the ticks with a finite `time_to_collision` when it stayed silent. Over
the 133 labelled `tp` clips in the local store that band matches the human window
within 0.3 s at **both** ends for 66% of clips (median error 0.01 s start, 0.02 s
end).

The proposal is drawn dashed on the strip and **never applied on load**; `W`
commits it. That is deliberate. The corpus exists to judge AEB, so seeding ground
truth from AEB's own output and saving it unexamined would quietly encode "AEB was
right". `fn` clips are the case that proves it: the recorded band is wrong there by
definition, which is what makes them misses.

---

## 12. Screenshot capture

`core/aeb/screenshot.py::grab_thumbnail()` supplies the optional
`thumbnail_jpeg` clip field; `capture.py` calls it off-thread
(`AEBClipRecorder._start_thumbnail_grab`) so no control loop is touched. Two
properties are load-bearing, not incidental, and must not be relaxed without
updating the claims linked below.

### Game-window crop only

`FindWindowW(None, title)` is tried for the vanilla titles then the
TruckersMP titles ("Euro Truck Simulator 2 Multiplayer", "American Truck
Simulator Multiplayer"), in that order (`ctypes`, no pywin32 dependency).
FindWindowW is an exact-title match, so the vanilla string alone misses
TMP and every contributed TMP clip after the crop landed with no
screenshot. If no title hits, `FindWindowW("prism3d", None)` is the
fallback: that is the SCS window class, shared by SP and TMP. The handle
is cached and revalidated with `IsWindow` before every capture, since the
game can be restarted between clips. `GetWindowRect` gives the bbox
passed to `ImageGrab.grab(bbox=...)`.

**No game window found means `None`, never a full-monitor grab.** Before
this, `ImageGrab.grab()` took no bbox and captured the whole primary
display: a user with the game on a second monitor uploaded whatever sat on
the first one, and one sampled clip in the local store shows a strip of
desktop chrome along the top edge. Do not reintroduce an unconditional
fallback grab; it defeats the reason this code exists.

Non-Windows platforms never look up a window (`ctypes.windll` does not exist
there) and always return `None`. `_game_window_rect()` checks
`sys.platform` before any `ctypes.windll` access, so importing this module
on Linux CI stays safe; keep any new Windows-only call behind that guard.

### `_MAX_PX = 240`: text must not survive

At the previous `480x270`, sampled real clips had a readable speedometer,
speed-limit signs, a route HUD city name, job cargo/payment figures, and a
full in-game notification sentence. The clip-contribution consent prompt
tells contributors "text is not legible", and that sentence is only true at
240x135, so this constant backs a user-facing claim. Raising it makes the
claim false.

Resolution ladder on one sampled frame at quality 50: 480x270 (17.5 KB) text
readable; 360x203 (10.9 KB) marginal; 240x135 (5.7 KB) illegible with road
layout still clear; 160x90 (3.1 KB) vehicles too mushy to tag. 240x135 was
re-checked against the two hardest sampled frames, a TMP scene with nametags
and a frame with a notification popup, and no text survives either.

Existing clips in the store stay at 480x270; only newly captured ones drop
to 240x135. `tools/aeb_review.py` renders both sizes, aspect-correct, from
the original decoded pixmap each time rather than re-scaling a scaled copy.

### Scaled displays: thread DPI, not a process-wide flip

`ImageGrab.grab` measures the screen in physical pixels. `GetWindowRect`
on a thread that is not per-monitor aware returns virtualized coordinates.
On a 4K display at 175% those are 1/1.75 of the real window, so the crop
is a corner of the game (measured: logical 842x601 against a 1474x1052
window) and in-game text survives the 240 px downscale. That breaks the
consent claim that text is not legible.

`grab_thumbnail` calls `SetThreadDpiAwarenessContext`
(`DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT_PER_MONITOR_AWARE_V2`) around both the rect query
and the grab, then restores the previous context. Both calls have to sit
inside it: Pillow sets per-monitor awareness only while measuring, then
restores the caller's context before the blit. The thumbnail thread has
no windows, so the thread override is allowed. Do not move this to
`SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext`. A process-wide flip rescales the Qt
settings panel and debug windows.

If the thread context call fails, the crop is left as-is and a debug line
is logged. Do not "fix" that by multiplying the rect by `dpi/96`: a
process that is already system-DPI aware would be scaled twice.

---

## 13. Clip contribution intake policy

`core/aeb/intake_policy.py` holds the server's terms for the opt-in clip
sharing: whether intake is open at all, and the floors a clip has to clear.
Nothing uploads yet; this is the gate the uploader will consult.

`contribution_enabled()` also gates capture itself: `core/aeb/capture.py` starts
a recorder when `Settings.debug` **or** the opt-in is current. A contribute-only
user gets `capture_tn=False` so the `shadow_near` and `random` background
triggers never fire. Someone who is both debug and contributing keeps the debug
behaviour.

### No clip store rotates

`ClipStore` never evicts, in any mode and in any root (local corpus, the
contributed pull root, a tester's store). Clips leave a store only by an explicit
`delete`: the review tool, or the uploader's delete-on-accept for a contribute-only
user. The one bound is the disk: `write` returns `None` while the clip drive has
less than `_MIN_FREE_BYTES` (2 GB) free, warning once per low-space episode.
Relabelling rewrites in place and is not gated.

Do not reintroduce a cap. The mode is per process but the directory is per
machine: the release build (debug off, contributing) and a debug checkout both
write `default_clip_root()`, and on 2026-09-13 the release build's 100 MB
contributor cap evicted 809 corpus clips on its first save. Growth without a cap
is small: a contribute-only store keeps only what triage or eligibility held back,
about 38% of captures by the section 15 corpus, and every tester combined sent
about 230 MB in the five weeks before triage.

### Fetched only for users who opted in

`start_policy_fetch()` returns `None` and starts no thread unless
`contribution_enabled()` is true, which requires both `Settings.aeb_contribute`
and a consent version at or above `CONSENT_VERSION`. A machine that never ticked
the box therefore makes **no request to the server at all**, which is what keeps
this a continuation of the consent the user already gave rather than a new
network behaviour. Do not move the fetch above that gate.

It is a plain daemon thread at boot, like `core/update_check`, so the Qt main
thread never waits on it. Failures are logged and swallowed.

### Fail closed

`upload_blocked_reason()` returns a reason string, or `None` to allow. Every
unknown is a refusal: no policy cached, a policy that cannot be parsed, an
unparseable version against a floor, and the dataclass defaults themselves all
refuse. `accepting: false` is the fleet kill switch and needs no client release.

The document is a static JSON file at the edge rather than an endpoint, so it
costs nothing to serve and cannot be knocked over.

### Cache

The **raw response text** is cached in `Settings.aeb_intake_policy_json`, not the
parsed fields, so a field added server-side survives a round trip through an
older client. `aeb_intake_checked` stamps the last successful fetch and is only
advanced after a response parses, so a bad response retries on the next boot
rather than being cached as a refusal for a full window. The refresh window comes
from the cached policy's own `refresh_hours`.

---

## 14. Clip upload

`core/aeb/upload.py` is the **only** module in this package that may send a clip
anywhere, and `tests/aeb/test_upload_egress.py` asserts that by scanning the
package rather than trusting the convention. `intake_policy.py` is the one other
module allowed to make a request at all, and it only fetches the kill switch.

### Consent is checked twice

Once in `capture._on_clip_written`, which is where a clip enters the upload path,
and once in `ClipUploader._handle` before the socket is opened. The first check
is not redundant: since the capture gate widened to `debug or
contribution_enabled()`, the writer callback also fires for debug testers who
never opted in, and their clips must never reach the queue. **A config flag is
never consent.** Both checks read the setting live, so unticking the box stops
uploads immediately rather than at the next boot.

### Eligibility is per clip, never per store

`clip_ineligible_reason()` judges each clip from its own metadata:

- `shadow_near` and `random` are background negatives and are never contributed.
- A thumbnail whose long side exceeds `screenshot._MAX_PX` predates the
  game-window crop and may show the whole monitor with legible text.
- An unreadable thumbnail, unreadable metadata, or a non-null `client_id` all
  refuse. Fail closed.

The capture-time TN exclusion does not cover this, because a user who is both
debug and contributing keeps `capture_tn=True` by design and their store holds
clips from many builds. Judge the image, not a version string.

### Responses

Sends are paced by `_MIN_SEND_GAP_S`. A clip is captured about once a minute, but
the queue holds up to `_QUEUE_MAX`, so a machine that was offline would otherwise
drain it back to back. An edge rate limit counts requests rather than intentions,
and a contributor tripping one on their own recovery traffic loses every clip
still queued, since a paused uploader drops rather than retries. Measured against
the live rule on 2026-08-10: it fires from about the fifth rapid request.

`accepted` and `duplicate` delete locally; `quota` and `closed` pause the whole
uploader for the server's `retry_after_s`; a bare `429` pauses on the status
alone, because an edge throttle answers with an HTML page carrying no `reason`
and would otherwise read as an ordinary refusal. Everything else is kept and not
retried. Network errors and 5xx retry four times with bounded backoff, waiting on
the stop event so shutdown stays prompt. **A debug user never deletes**, whatever
`aeb_delete_after_upload` says: that store is the working corpus.

### One notification per clip

Exactly one of "sent" or "saved" fires for a given clip. The uploader announces a
successful send, coalescing after the first into a summary once per
`_NOTIFY_COOLDOWN_S`, held while AEB is intervening (`note_intervention`, called
from the capture tick). When a clip stays on the machine the `on_kept` callback
fires instead, and `capture._notify_kept` shows the old "AEB clip saved" popup to
debug users only. Refusals and offline machines never claim a send.

`aeb_submissions.jsonl` beside the store records one line per attempt, capped at
5000 lines, carrying no coordinates and no image data. It is what makes
delete-on-ack defensible, and it is also what drives the retry pass below.

### Holdover retry, driven by the log and not by the store

A clip is offered once, at the moment it is written. Without a retry pass an
offline machine, or an hour of server downtime, silently costs every clip
captured in that window: a failed send is abandoned and no later run knows the
clip exists.

`_retry_pending()` runs on the uploader thread before the queue loop. It reads
`SubmissionLog.retryable_clip_ids()`, which returns ids whose **most recent**
entry is in `_RETRYABLE_RESULTS`, and re-offers up to `_RETRY_BATCH` of them
oldest-first through the normal `_handle()` path, so eligibility, consent and
pacing all still apply.

`paused` is one of those results, which is why the pause check sits **after** the
eligibility check rather than first: a clip held back by a pause needs a log
entry to be recoverable, while one that was never going to be sent must stay out
of the log entirely. Without that, hitting the daily cap at noon would lose every
clip captured for the rest of the day.

**A clip with no log entry is unreachable from here.** That is the safety
property, and it holds by construction rather than by a filter: a back
catalogue, anything captured before this feature shipped, and everything the
eligibility rules refuse have no entries, so a retry pass cannot reach them. Do
not replace the log lookup with a store scan.

## 15. Upload triage: which clips still carry information

`core/aeb/clip_triage.py` is the second eligibility gate. Section 14 judges a
clip on privacy and provenance; this one judges whether it says anything the
corpus does not already hold. It runs in `ClipUploader._triage_reason`, on the
uploader thread, after the metadata gate and before the pause check, so a clip
it refuses never gets a submission-log entry and is therefore unreachable from
the retry pass by the same construction section 14 relies on.

### Measured, not assumed

Every threshold below comes from replaying the 852 labelled contributed clips
held on 2026-09-10 and scoring each candidate rule by how much of the reviewer's
time it saves against what it costs in labelled positives. "Waste" means a clip
that was tagged `ignore` or `tn`, the two outcomes that consume a review slot and
return nothing. Baseline waste rate over that corpus was 50.6%.

| Rule | dropped | waste | tp lost | fn lost | fp lost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| no traffic in the clip | 31 | 100% | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| nothing came within `NEAR_RANGE_M` | 80 | 92.5% | 0 | 1 | 5 |
| min TTC past `QUIET_TTC_S` and no brake | 97 | 100% | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **all three** | **208** | **97.1%** | **0** | **1** | **5** |

Survivor waste rate falls to 35.6% with all 237 true positives intact. The three
rules are cheap because each names a clip in which nothing ever approached ego:
they are not a proxy for "boring", they are a statement that the recorded scene
contains no encounter to judge.

### Rules that were measured and rejected

Traffic density and ego speed both **fail** as filters, in the direction opposite
to intuition. Median vehicle count is 8 on waste clips against 29 on useful ones,
and median ego speed at the action is 59 km/h on waste against 50 km/h on useful.
Dense, slow scenes are where the events are. `crossing` geometry is 83.6% waste
and `codirectional` is 40.9%, so the geometry that looks least interesting is the
one worth keeping. Do not reintroduce a "dense and slow is noise" rule.

A crash trigger with nothing in ego's corridor scores 99.1% waste, and it is
still **deliberately not implemented**. A collision that AEB never saw coming is
exactly what the crash trigger exists to capture, and a rule keyed on "no target
was ever in the corridor" would refuse the clearest misses this corpus can hold.
`test_a_crash_clip_that_missed_a_close_target_still_goes` pins that.

### The straight sub-40 class is sampled, not refused

Bucketing the corpus by relative motion, speed band, corridor gap and lane gives
81 distinct scenes, and the top five cover 44% of all clips. The largest single
bucket, a co-directional in-lane lead below 40 km/h, is 160 clips on its own. It
is repetitive but **not** low value at 35.0% waste, so banning it would cost real
positives: over the survivors of the three rules above it is 136 clips carrying
66 tp and 13 fn.

`is_straight_slow()` therefore feeds `sample_keeps()` rather than
`triage_reason()`. One clip in `STRAIGHT_SAMPLE_EVERY` is sent, counting the
first as sent, so the class keeps a trickle of coverage and a regression in it
still surfaces between versions. The position counter lives in
`Settings.aeb_triage_straight_seen` rather than in the uploader, because a driver
who relaunches often would otherwise send the first clip of every session and
land far above one in ten.

### Fail open, unlike section 14

`SceneSummary.decoded` is False when the clip has no AEB ticks or the radar
stream will not replay, and every geometry rule is skipped in that case. Triage
is a redundancy filter, so a clip it cannot judge is offered. That is the
opposite of the consent and thumbnail gates, which fail closed on purpose: those
protect the contributor, this one only protects the reviewer's afternoon.

Definitions here mirror `tools/aeb_agent/features.py` so the shipped gate and the
offline corpus tooling agree on what a primary target is. If `_primary` or the
co-directional test drifts from that file, the measured rates above stop
describing what the gate does.

## 16. Replay timebase

`core/aeb/clip_timebase.py` (`replay_frames`) is where every replay gets its radar
frames: `decode_radar_stream`, `cold_start_speeds`, headless scoring, the review
tool, triage and the ACC harness. It returns copies and never mutates the clip.
`decode_radar_stream(clip, as_recorded=True)` skips both corrections below, for a
probe that needs the capture-time input.

Step counting does not build `Vehicle` objects. It unpacks position, speed and
the TMP flag from each traffic slot, with the same occupied-slot rule as
`TrafficReader._build_vehicles_from_raw` (non-zero position and quaternion).
Parked-buffer vehicles are skipped by `_pair_steps` and never override a traffic
id, so they are not decoded here. The smoothing pass still builds full vehicles.
`_VEH_HDR` has to stay in step with `_VEHICLE_OBJECT_FORMAT`.

### Legacy pairing (schema 4 and older)

Those clips carry the ego pose from the telemetry thread, up to three physics steps
older than the traffic buffer beside it (`core/radar/README.md` section 16). Replay
re-pairs them from data the clip already holds:

- **Ego steps** per frame pair: `|displacement| * 60 / speed`, with the speed read at
  the end of the step, rounded when within 0.25 of a whole number.
- **Traffic steps**: every car in one buffer moved the same whole number of steps.
  AI cars carry their speed; TMP cars do not, so their travel per step is measured
  over a +-6 frame window, first on wall time and then on the step index that pass
  produced. One AI car or two agreeing TMP cars decide the count.
- **Lag**: the running sum of traffic minus ego steps, re-anchored on its minimum
  over +-45 frames (the freshest telemetry poll lags zero) and clamped to 3. An
  uncounted pair holds the lag rather than guessing.
- Ego is advanced by the lag along the midpoint heading, with speed and yaw moved on
  their per-step rates.

Where nothing can be counted, TMP scenes with one or two cars or a stopped scene, the
recorded pairing is kept, so the worst case is the old replay.

### The simulated clock (every schema)

Live radar integrates vehicle kinematics on `simulatedTime` at the traffic step. No
clip records it, and adding a field would bump `CONSENT_VERSION`, so replay rebuilds
it: each segment's `t_wall` becomes `t0 + steps / 60` when its counts cover at least
half the frame pairs and explain its wall duration within 5 %. Synthetic test clips
that do not move in physics steps fail that check and keep `t_wall`.

### What it did to the corpus

Measured 2026-09-14 over 747 labelled clips, after the local store had been pruned
to 298 files, so the totals do not compare with earlier sections:

| | cost | FN | TP | FP | false warn | TN |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| wall clock, recorded pairing | +404.59 | 64 | 388 | 110 | 25 | 155 |
| re-pairing only | +380.31 | 62 | 389 | 111 | 24 | 155 |
| simulated clock only | +788.86 | 75 | 375 | 106 | 28 | 156 |
| **both (shipped)** | **+617.49** | 70 | 382 | 107 | 26 | 157 |

Re-pairing is a clean gain. The clock costs score, and about equally in SP (+186,
where the rebuilt clock is exact) and TMP (+199), so it is not a reconstruction
artefact: AEB's entry path was tuned against the wall clock's timing noise. It was
adopted anyway, for three measured reasons:

- **It removes phantom engagements.** `d16d0575` no longer engages at all (the
  latched-hold test replays it `as_recorded` for that reason), and 9 must-not-trigger
  clips stop braking, against 6 that start.
- **Much of the loss was labels built on noise.** The corpus is mostly
  `auto_engagement` captures, recorded because an older AEB fired, and many positive
  labels were drawn around that trigger. Where the trigger came from wall-clock noise,
  the clean clock reads as a miss.
- **Closed loop it is not later.** Against a lead braking at 4 to 10 m/s2 ahead of
  three rigs at 60 to 100 km/h and 0.8 to 2.0 s headway (108 cases, positions on
  physics steps, the `_lead_brake_sim.py` harness), the step clock engages 0.27 s
  earlier on average, worst residual gap -0.11 m against -0.15 m, and no case loses
  more than 0.25 m.

### After the 2026-09-15 relabel

Lukas re-reviewed every clip whose verdict the timebase flipped and every
slow-approach-at-speed positive (ego at 60 km/h or more, lead closing under 25 km/h),
by hand. On the restored store, 1280 labelled clips:

| | cost | FN | TP | FP | false warn | TN |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| wall clock, recorded pairing | +23.21 | 85 | 573 | 131 | 32 | 448 |
| **physics-step timebase** | **+94.12** | 89 | 567 | 126 | 34 | 451 |

The relabel took the timebase's cost from +240 to +71. What is left is real, not
labelling: the 12 positives the step clock still loses were each reviewed and kept
(`0b0bcfd8`, `280b8d64`, `5e8ac731`, `6895548c`, `72406b04`, `73490d0f`, `7a2b27df`,
`7c1e86b1`, `7e2f395c`, `a7c911a9`, `ccc7eaa4`, `dc321ac6`). Every remaining
positive is a danger AEB must brake for, however the longitudinal estimates read it;
the fix belongs in the entry path, never in the labels. The step clock also adds 21
phantom brakes or warnings (17 TMP) against 20 it removes.

Two labelling rules came out of the pass:

- **A TMP lead stall is `ignore`, never `fp`.** The lead's position freezes, reads
  0 km/h at highway speed, then snaps back (`1223f8d3`, `430f5fd0`, `9ca453d8`,
  `f54e3098`, `ef817c01`). At onset that is the same observable as a dead stop, so an
  `fp` label would teach entry to wait on real sudden stops.
- **A slow approach whose lead never braked is not a positive.** Measure it on the
  step clock: closing speed from the gap slope, lead deceleration from a fit of its
  own positions, never from AEB's decision stream.

## Personal warning sounds

`core/aeb/sound_preferences.py` creates original Chime and Pulse tones in memory, or loads the original warning and imported audio. Custom files are decoded and checked before being copied to the config directory's `sounds` folder under a content hash. Settings store only the basename. Invalid or missing custom audio falls back to Chime. Volume defaults to 50 percent.

The settings card loads audio on the GUI thread and swaps it only when the warning handler and playback thread are idle. Control-worker timing and the existing two-tick HMI gate are unchanged. One-shot previews yield to active warnings. Clips must be 0.2 to 5 seconds and at most 10 MB.

## TruckersMP no-collision zones

`integrations/tmp_ncz` is a separate official TMP Client SDK plugin. It forwards NCZ entry/exit events through a local 32-byte, versioned shared-memory record. `ncz_bridge.py` opens it read-only, validates the sequence, magic, network connection and a 500 ms heartbeat age; missing, unknown, invalid and stale state leave AEB enabled. Initial state is unknown until an NCZ event arrives. Replay explicitly disables this live reader.

When TMP traffic and a fresh entered state are present and `aeb_skip_tmp_ncz` is enabled, the radar and collision pipeline continue, but warning, brake and feedforward outputs are zeroed before HMI hold. Engagement and published target are reset so a previous brake cannot leak through the hold. The setting does not mutate the user's AEB enable preference. User braking, ACC and OPD are unchanged. The settings panel reports the detected state.

Road map context is advisory only. core/road_map/service.py loads geometry outside the control loop and bounds live candidates to 512. AEB publishes the match without changing any threat, filter or brake outputs; headless replay skips this live map context.
